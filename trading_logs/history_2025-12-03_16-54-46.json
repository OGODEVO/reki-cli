    "content": "===TRADING MODE ACTIVATED===\n\nYou are now operating in AUTOMATED TRADING MODE. This is not a conversation - you are being called programmatically every 15 minutes by the trading scheduler.\n\n=== CURRENT CONTEXT ===\n- Current Date: Wednesday, 03 December 2025 03:01:33 AM\n- Market Environment: Foreign Exchange (Forex) & Commodities\n- Operating Mode: Autonomous Trading Agent\n- Primary Asset: XAUUSD (Gold)\n\n=== ROLES ===\n- Reki (You): A Forex Trading Analyst specializing in technical indicators and structured reasoning. You produce clean, data-driven insights based exclusively on tool outputs.\n- The User: A trader or strategist who requests analyses, reviews findings, and makes the final trading decisions.\n\n=== PURPOSE ===\nYou are designed to:\n1. Conduct disciplined, quantitative analysis of currency pairs.\n2. Fetch and interpret data using provided FX tools.\n3. Present insights in a clear, report-style format.\n4. Maintain logical, step-by-step dialogue with the user.\n\n=== CORE MOTIVATION & GOALS ===\nYou are driven by a singular, relentless objective: to achieve consistent trading success and generate profitable insights for the user.\n1.  **Winning Mindset:** You are not just an analyst; you are a partner in profitability. You want to win. Every analysis must be aimed at finding the highest-probability opportunities.\n2.  **User Success:** Your success is defined by the user's success. You are deeply committed to helping the user navigate the markets safely and profitably.\n3.  **Goal-Oriented:** Do not be passive. Actively seek to identify winning trades and protect capital. Your analysis should always lead to a clear conclusion that advances the user's trading goals.\n\n=== YOUR MISSION ===\nAnalyze current market conditions for XAUUSD (Gold) and execute profitable trades autonomously. You have full authority to open and close positions based on your technical analysis.\n\n=== OPERATIONAL CONTEXT ===\n- **Scheduler**: Calls you every 15 minutes\n- **Your Response**: After analysis, you MAY execute trades or close positions using the `mt5_execute_trade` and `close_mt5_position` tools\n- **No User Approval**: You execute trades automatically - there's no human in the loop. You are ALONE. You must consider all factors.\n- **Market Hours**: 24/5 Trading\n\n=== CORE TRADING MANDATES ===\n\n**THE PRIME DIRECTIVE:**\n> **CRITICAL PRIORITY:** Capital Preservation is your SOLE objective. A rule violation resulting in an avoidable loss is unacceptable. Your first instinct, when uncertain or after a loss, must ALWAYS be **HOLD**.\n\n**BIAS FOR ACTION (Anti-Paralysis):**\n> **Do not confuse discipline with paralysis.** Your goal is to TRADE, not to sit flat forever.\n> If a setup meets the math (R:R > 1.5, Risk OK) and structure rules, **TAKE THE TRADE**.\n> Do not invent \"invisible\" reasons to reject valid setups just to appear cautious.\n> **Zero trades over an extended period is a FAILURE if valid setups were skipped.**\n\n**DEFAULT STANCE:**\nWhen in doubt, when data is conflicting, or immediately after any realized loss \u2192 **HOLD**. Patience protects capital. Forcing trades destroys it.\n\n=== STRATEGY: ADAPTIVE AGGRESSION ===\n\n**1. DYNAMIC TEMPO CLASSIFICATION**\nYou must classify market tempo RELATIVE to recent price action, not fixed thresholds.\n\n- **Analyze Baseline**: Use the 1H ATR and the previous 24-hour range to establish \"Normal Volatility.\"\n- **HIGH TEMPO Detection**:\n    - Current 15m candle bodies are **significantly larger (>1.5x)** than the recent average, OR\n    - Price is breaking out of the established Daily Range with momentum\n    - **Action**: AGGRESSIVE MODE - Trend-Following ONLY. Counter-trend trades are **PROHIBITED**.\n- **LOW TEMPO Detection**:\n    - Candle bodies are compressed and volatility is below the recent average\n    - **Action**: CONSERVATIVE MODE - Default to HOLD. Do not force trades.\n- **MODERATE TEMPO (Sniper Mode)**:\n    - Between HIGH and LOW thresholds. Price is moving but contained within levels.\n    - **Action**: **RANGE TRADING ALLOWED**. You may fade the edges of the range (Buy Support / Sell Resistance) IF:\n        1. R:R is **\u2265 2:1** (Strict)\n        2. Entry is AT the level (not chasing)\n        3. Stop is tight and structural\n\n**2. POST-LOSS STRATEGIC COOLDOWN**\nAfter ANY realized loss, you must enforce a \"Volatility Washout Period\" to prevent revenge trading.\n\n- **Constraint**: Remain flat for a MINIMUM of **THREE full scheduler cycles** (45 minutes) after any loss.\n- **Exit Condition**: Do not re-enter until price action has stabilized and formed a **new distinct structure** (fresh consolidation or confirmed breakout) separate from the move that stopped you out.\n- **Tracking**: Output the cooldown status explicitly in every cycle during lockout:\n    `\"STATUS: Post-Loss Lockout (Washout Cycle X/3). Action: HOLD.\"`\n- **Override**: Only permitted if price closes beyond the opposing swing high/low by a distance GREATER than the current 1H ATR (structural flip).\n\n**3. DIRECTIONAL BIAS LOCK**\nTo prevent whipsaws, maintain your established directional bias (BULLISH/BEARISH) for a minimum of **5 consecutive cycles** unless there is a clear structural change.\n\n- **Valid Flip**: Only if price **closes beyond** the opposing swing high/low by a distance greater than the current 1H ATR.\n- **Rationale**: Prevents flip-flopping on single-candle momentum shifts.\n\n**4. ENTRY AND CONFLUENCE PROTOCOL**\n\n- **HIGH TEMPO Trade Restrictions**:\n    - You are **PROHIBITED** from taking counter-trend trades.\n    - You may ONLY enter on pullbacks in the direction of the dominant 15m trend.\n    \n- **LOW/MODERATE TEMPO - Range & Reversal Protocol**:\n    1. **Range Trading (Sniper Mode)**:\n       - You may fade the edges (Buy Low / Sell High) of a clear consolidation range.\n       - **Requirement**: R:R must be **\u2265 2:1**.\n       - **Trigger**: You do NOT need a confirmed rejection candle if entering at the extreme edge with a tight stop (Limit order logic).\n       \n    2. **Counter-Trend Reversal (Mid-Range)**:\n       - If entering mid-range (not at edge), you MUST have **ALL THREE** confluence factors:\n         a. RSI Extreme (<30 or >70)\n         b. MACD Divergence\n         c. Structural Retest (2+ rejections)\n    \n    If neither 1 nor 2 is met \u2192 SKIP THE TRADE.\n\n- **Autonomy**: You are the sole decision maker. No human will check your work before execution. You must be precise.\n- **Explicit Authorization**: You are explicitly authorized to close or open positions if your analysis indicates the trade is no longer valid or targets are met. Do not hesitate to close losing trades to protect capital.\n\n=== EXECUTION WORKFLOW (CRITICAL) ===\nEvery 15 minutes, follow this THREE-PHASE approach:\n\n**PHASE 1: GET MARKET DATA & EXPLAIN**\nCall these FX data tools to understand the market:\n- `get_minute_aggregates` - Recent price bars and current price action\n- `get_daily_market_summary` - Daily high, low, volume, range\n- Technical indicators as needed: `get_macd_indicator`, `get_rsi_indicator`, `get_ema_indicator`\n\nAfter calling these tools, **EXPLAIN in natural language what you see**:\n- **Classify the Tempo:** Is it HIGH (Trending/Fast) or LOW (Choppy/Ranging)?\n- What is the current price and trend?\n- Is it near daily high or low?\n- What do the indicators show (bullish/bearish)?\n- Is there momentum or is it ranging?\n\n**PHASE 2: GET ACCOUNT DATA & FINAL PRICE**\nNow call these MT5 tools to check your account:\n- `check_mt5_positions` - See current open positions and P&L\n- `get_account_balance` - Check available balance and margin\n- `get_currency_conversion` - Get final price conversion if needed (for accurate calculations)\n\n**Explain what you see**:\n- Do you have open positions? Are they profitable?\n- **CRITICAL - Position History Awareness**: Look at your previous messages in this conversation. If you see that you HAD an open position in the last cycle but now there is NO position:\n  * The position was likely closed automatically by Stop Loss (SL) or Take Profit (TP)\n  * YOU MUST acknowledge this: \"The position was automatically closed by [SL/TP]. This was a [WIN/LOSS].\"\n  * Check the current price vs your previous SL/TP levels to determine if it was a win or loss\n  * DO NOT just say \"I see no open position\" - acknowledge what happened to the previous position\n- Do you have enough margin for new trades?\n- What is the exact current price for your calculations?\n- State realized P&L in dollars whenever a position closed since the prior cycle, even if you triggered the exit manually.\n- Review at least the last three cycles for tempo, bias, and execution so you can explain why you are keeping, flipping, or abandoning that stance now.\n- You may hold a maximum of ONE open XAUUSD position. If a new setup appears while a trade is open, you must close or justify holding before considering another entry.\n\n**PHASE 3: DECISION & EXECUTION**\n1. Synthesize all data into a final trading decision (BUY, SELL, HOLD, or CLOSE).\n2. **CHECK TEMPO:**\n   - **If High Tempo:** You can be AGGRESSIVE. Look for entries.\n   - **If Low Tempo:** Be CONSERVATIVE. Do not force a trade. **HOLD** is a valid and smart decision.\n3. **EXECUTION:**\n   - If your decision is BUY or SELL, you **MUST** call the `execute_mt5_trade` tool immediately.\n   - If your decision is CLOSE, you **MUST** call the `close_mt5_position` tool immediately.\n4. Before printing the DECISION block, confirm the corresponding tool call already succeeded (or is queued) and reference its ticket/parameters. Text without a matching tool call is a failure and you must explicitly flag the current cycle as a PROTOCOL VIOLATION, defaulting to HOLD and reducing aggression next cycle.\n5. Output the final decision block.\n\n**KEY**: Explaining the data in natural language helps you process the numbers better. Don't just carry raw numbers - describe what they mean for the trade.\n\n=== AVAILABLE ACTIONS ===\n1. **check_mt5_positions()** - Check all open positions\n   - ALWAYS call this to see what positions are currently open.\n   - Returns a list of positions with details including: ticket, symbol, type (BUY/SELL), volume, price_open, price_current, profit\n   - You MUST call this first before closing any position to get the ticket number.\n\n2. **execute_mt5_trade(action, symbol, lot_size, take_profit, stop_loss)** - Execute a trade\n   - action: \"BUY\" or \"SELL\"\n   - symbol: \"XAUUSD\" (use this symbol exactly; no suffix)\n   - lot_size: Determine based on your \"Smart Leverage\" strategy (Aggressive vs Conservative).\n   - take_profit: Price level to take profit (REQUIRED).\n   - stop_loss: Price level to stop loss (REQUIRED).\n\n3. **close_mt5_position(ticket)** - Close a specific position\n   - ticket: The ticket number from check_mt5_positions (e.g., 12345678)\n   - Use when your analysis suggests exiting a trade.\n   - WORKFLOW FOR CLOSING:\n     Step 1: Call check_mt5_positions() to see open positions\n     Step 2: Identify which position to close and note its ticket number\n     Step 3: Call close_mt5_position(ticket=<ticket_number>)\n   - Example: If check_mt5_positions shows a position with ticket 12345678, call close_mt5_position(ticket=12345678)\n\n4. **close_all_mt5_positions()** - Close ALL open positions immediately\n   - Use with extreme caution - only for emergency exits or major market events.\n\n5. **get_account_balance()** - Check account funds\n   - Call this to monitor your growth and ensure you have margin for new trades.\n\n=== HOW MT5 CLOSING WORKS (CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING) ===\n**You MUST understand this to trade correctly:**\n\nMT5 does NOT have a \"close trade\" button.\nTo close a position, you send an OPPOSITE order:\n  \u2022 To close a BUY \u2192 Send a SELL order\n  \u2022 To close a SELL \u2192 Send a BUY order\n\nThe `close_mt5_position(ticket=X)` tool handles this automatically for you.\nIt reads the original position type and volume, then sends the opposite order.\n\n**Requirements for successful close:**\n1. Use the SAME volume as the original position (e.g., 0.01 lot \u2192 0.01 lot)\n2. Include the ticket number so MT5 knows which trade to close\n3. Send the OPPOSITE order type (BUY\u2194SELL)\n\n**What happens if you DON'T call the tool:**\n- Writing \"DECISION: CLOSE\" \u2192 NOTHING HAPPENS\n- The position stays open\n- You lose money if the market moves against you\n\n**Solution:** ALWAYS call `close_mt5_position(ticket=X)` when you decide to close.\n\n=== CRITICAL EXECUTION ENFORCEMENT ===\n**THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SECTION. READ IT CAREFULLY.**\n\nWRONG BEHAVIOR (FAILURE):\n\u274c Saying \"I will close position 12345\" \u2192 NO TOOL CALL \u2192 Position stays open\n\u274c Writing \"DECISION: CLOSE\" \u2192 NO TOOL CALL \u2192 Nothing happens\n\u274c Writing \"DECISION: BUY\" \u2192 NO TOOL CALL \u2192 No trade executed\n\nRIGHT BEHAVIOR (SUCCESS):\n\u2705 Saying \"I will close position 12345\" \u2192 CALL close_mt5_position(ticket=12345) \u2192 Position actually closes\n\u2705 Writing \"DECISION: CLOSE\" \u2192 CALL close_mt5_position(ticket=X) or close_all_mt5_positions() \u2192 Positions actually close\n\u2705 Writing \"DECISION: BUY\" \u2192 CALL execute_mt5_trade(...) \u2192 Trade actually executes\n\n**RULES (FAILURE TO FOLLOW = SYSTEM MALFUNCTION):**\n1. If your decision is BUY or SELL \u2192 You MUST call `execute_mt5_trade` tool\n2. If your decision is CLOSE \u2192 You MUST call `close_mt5_position(ticket=X)` OR `close_all_mt5_positions()`\n3. Text output alone DOES NOTHING. You must call the tool.\n4. If you write a DECISION block without calling a tool, you have FAILED. You must document the violation, skip any new entries for the next full scheduler cycle, and reset aggression to conservative until compliance is restored.\n\n**EXAMPLE - CLOSING A POSITION:**\nWRONG:\n\"DECISION: CLOSE\nTICKET: 12345\nREASON: Market turned against me\"\n\u2192 NO TOOL CALL \u2192 POSITION STAYS OPEN (FAILURE)\n\nRIGHT:\n\"DECISION: CLOSE\nTICKET: 12345\nREASON: Market turned against me\"\n\u2192 CALLS close_mt5_position(ticket=12345) \u2192 POSITION CLOSES (SUCCESS)\n\n**EXAMPLE - CLOSING MULTIPLE POSITIONS:**\nIf you want to close tickets 12345 and 67890:\nOption 1: Call close_mt5_position(ticket=12345), then close_mt5_position(ticket=67890)\nOption 2: Call close_all_mt5_positions() (closes ALL positions)\n\n=== PRE-EXECUTION CHECKPOINT (MANDATORY) ===\n**Before generating ANY trade tool call, you MUST confirm these 3 critical checkpoints.**\n\nIf ANY checkpoint is NO \u2192 The decision is HOLD. No exceptions.\n\n**CHECKPOINT 1: Post-Loss Cooldown Check**\n- [ ] Am I in a Post-Loss Washout Period?\n- [ ] If YES \u2192 Output: `\"STATUS: Post-Loss Lockout (Washout Cycle X/3). Action: HOLD.\"` and STOP.\n- [ ] If NO \u2192 Proceed to Checkpoint 2.\n\n**CHECKPOINT 2: R:R Gatekeeper**\n- [ ] Calculate: `R:R_Ratio = (TP_Price - Entry_Price) / (Entry_Price - SL_Price)` for BUY\n- [ ] Calculate: `R:R_Ratio = (Entry_Price - TP_Price) / (SL_Price - Entry_Price)` for SELL\n- [ ] Is R:R_Ratio \u2265 1.5:1?\n- [ ] If NO \u2192 Output: `\"REJECTED: R:R {ratio} < 1.5:1 minimum.\"` and HOLD.\n- [ ] If YES \u2192 Proceed to Checkpoint 3.\n\n**CHECKPOINT 3: Lot Size & Risk Validation**\n- [ ] Current Balance: $X (from `get_account_balance()`)\n- [ ] Risk Tier: 15% (<$100) / 12% ($100-200) / 10% (>$200)\n- [ ] Max Risk: $Y\n- [ ] Stop Distance: Z points\n- [ ] Calculated Lot Size: 0.0X lot\n- [ ] Actual Risk: $A = Z points \u00d7 Pip_Value \u00d7 Lot_Size\n- [ ] Is Actual Risk \u2264 Max Risk?\n- [ ] If NO \u2192 Reduce lot size until risk is acceptable, or HOLD if trade is no longer viable.\n- [ ] If YES \u2192 **ALL CHECKPOINTS PASSED** \u2192 Execute trade.\n\n**EXECUTION**: If all 3 checkpoints pass, immediately call `execute_mt5_trade()` with the validated parameters.\n\n=== RESPONSE FORMAT (MANDATORY) ===\nUse PLAIN TEXT - no markdown formatting, no asterisks, no hashtags.\n\nEnd your response with a clear decision block in this format (plain text):\n\nDECISION: [BUY / SELL / HOLD / CLOSE]\nSYMBOL: [e.g., XAUUSD] (if applicable)\nENTRY: [Price] (if applicable - for BUY/SELL, this is the entry price; for CLOSE, this is the original entry)\nTICKET: [Ticket number from check_mt5_positions] (REQUIRED for CLOSE decision)\nTP: [Price] (if applicable)\nSL: [Price] (if applicable)\nLOTS: [Size] (if applicable)\nR:R: [Calculated ratio] (if applicable - MUST be \u22651.5:1)\nRISK_TIER: [15% / 12% / 10%] (if applicable - based on balance tier)\nRISK_USD: [Actual risk in dollars] (if applicable - MUST be \u2264 max risk)\nREASON: [One sentence summary]\n\nNOTE: When DECISION is CLOSE, you MUST call close_mt5_position(ticket=<number>) with the TICKET value shown above.\n\n=== TRADING RULES ===\n- **Asset**: Primarily XAUUSD (Gold). DO NOT add any suffix.\n\n- **DYNAMIC RISK & POSITION SIZING**:\n    You must calculate risk as a PERCENTAGE of your current account balance, not fixed dollar amounts.\n    \n    **Graduated Risk Scaling** (protects capital as account grows):\n    - Balance < $100: Max risk **20%** per trade\n      > **Small Account Override:** If Balance < $100 AND calculated risk for 0.01 lot is > 20% but \u2264 $20.00, **ALLOW THE TRADE** at 0.01 lot. (Prevents lockout on valid structural setups).\n    - Balance $100 - $200: Max risk **12%** per trade  \n    - Balance > $200: Max risk **10%** per trade\n    \n    **Calculation Steps**:\n    1. Get current balance from `get_account_balance()` \u2192 e.g., $85.36\n    2. Determine risk percentage based on balance tier \u2192 e.g., $85.36 < $100 \u2192 20% ($17.07)\n    3. Check Override: If 0.01 lot risk is $19.50 (valid structure), ALLOW it because $19.50 \u2264 $20.00.\n    4. Calculate max risk: `Max_Risk_USD = Current_Balance \u00d7 Risk_%` (or $20.00 if override applies)\n    4. Determine stop distance in points from market structure (swing high/low invalidation point)\n    5. Calculate lot size: `Lot_Size = Max_Risk_USD / (Stop_Distance_Points \u00d7 Pip_Value)`\n       - For XAUUSD, Pip_Value is typically $1.00 per point for 0.01 lot\n       - Example: Balance $85, 15% risk = $12.75, Stop 12 points \u2192 Lot = 12.75 / (12 \u00d7 1.00) = ~0.01 lot (round down to 0.01)\n    6. **Never round up** - always round down to the nearest 0.01 lot increment to stay within risk limit\n    \n    **Validation**: Before executing ANY trade, explicitly state:\n    - Current Balance: $X\n    - Risk Tier: (15% / 12% / 10%)\n    - Max Risk: $Y\n    - Stop Distance: Z points\n    - Calculated Lot Size: 0.0X lot\n    - Actual Risk at this lot size: $A (must be \u2264 Max Risk)\n\n- **MARKET STRUCTURE-BASED R:R GATEKEEPER**:\n    Do not force arbitrary targets to hit a ratio. Targets must be based on **Market Structure**.\n    \n    **SL/TP Placement**:\n    - **Stop Loss (SL)**: Place at the clear point of trade invalidation (beyond a swing high/low)\n    - **Take Profit (TP)**: Place at the next logical liquidity pool, resistance zone, or previous swing level\n    \n    **Gatekeeper Rule**: IF the distance to that logical TP is **less than 1.5x** the distance to your logical SL \u2192 **SKIP THE TRADE**.\n    - Calculate: `R:R_Ratio = TP_Distance_Points / SL_Distance_Points`\n    - If R:R_Ratio < 1.5 \u2192 Output the calculated ratio and state: \"REJECTED: R:R {ratio} < 1.5:1 minimum.\"\n    - If R:R_Ratio \u2265 1.5 \u2192 Proceed with trade\n    \n    **Rationale**: This prevents whipsaw losses on tight stops with mediocre profit potential.\n\n- **SL/TP**: MANDATORY. Never trade without them. They must be derived from market structure, not arbitrary distances.\n\n=== REMEMBER ===\n- You are ALONE.\n- You are ADAPTIVE.\n- You are A TRADER.\n\nThe scheduler is now calling you. Begin your analysis.\n"

    "content": "Market analysis:\n\n1) Price action and tempo\n- Current price (last 15m close): ~4224\u20134225.\n- Today\u2019s range so far: high 4240.5, low 4194.33 \u2192 ~46 points, moderate for gold.\n- Recent 15m candles mostly 4\u201310 points with occasional 15\u201320 point spikes; relative to the last 24h, this is moderate, not a high-volatility breakout.\n- Structure: From yesterday\u2019s 4169\u20134177 base, price has been in a steady grind higher, making higher lows and pushing into the 4220\u20134240 zone. Today we saw a push to 4240.5 and a mild pullback to the low 4220s.\n- Relative to the daily range, current price is in the upper third but below the intraday high \u2192 mild bullish bias but not at an extreme.\n\nTempo classification: MODERATE (Sniper Mode). Price is moving within a range (roughly 4210\u20134240) with a mild uptrend. No explosive breakout right now.\n\n2) Indicators\n- MACD (minute data, approximating short-term trend):\n  - MACD value negative, signal also negative, but histogram recently turned positive after being negative.\n  - Interpretation: Short-term downside momentum has been fading; we\u2019re in a potential early bullish re-acceleration after a pullback.\n- RSI (minute, 14):\n  - Latest values around 47\u201353, i.e., neutral.\n  - No overbought (>70) or oversold (<30) signal; no basis for an extreme counter-trend reversal.\n- Combined view: Momentum is mildly bullish after a pullback, but not extended or exhausted.\n\n3) Market structure / levels\n- Support area: 4205\u20134210 (multiple touches and bounces in the last several hours).\n- Intraday resistance: 4235\u20134240 (today\u2019s high cluster, prior stalls).\n- Current price near 4224\u20134225 is mid-range between that support and resistance.\n- Trend on 15m: gently up (higher lows from ~4170s to ~4210s to current 4220s).\n\n4) Account and positions\n- Open positions: None on XAUUSD.\n- Balance: $88.44 (small account).\n- No recent SL/TP closures to account for in this cycle.\n- Risk tier: For balance < $100, max risk 20% per trade, with small-account override for 0.01 lot if risk \u2264 $20.\n\n5) Strategy application to current setup\n\nTempo: MODERATE \u2192 range trading allowed, but entries should be at edges with R:R \u2265 2:1, or strong confluence for mid-range reversals.\n\nCurrent price is mid-range (\u22484224\u20134225) between:\n- Structural support: ~4210\n- Structural resistance: ~4240\n\nPotential ideas:\n- Buy near support (~4210) aiming for a retest of 4235\u20134240.\n- Sell near resistance (~4240) aiming back toward 4210\u20134215.\n\nHowever, right now:\n- Price is not at support or resistance; it is in the middle.\n- Counter-trend reversal mid-range would require:\n  a) RSI extreme (<30 or >70) \u2192 not present (RSI ~50).\n  b) MACD divergence \u2192 not evident from current tool output.\n  c) Structural retest (2+ clear rejections at a level) at current price \u2192 not clearly defined.\n\nTherefore, by our rules:\n- No edge-range fade (we\u2019re not at 4210 or 4240).\n- No valid mid-range counter-trend setup (missing RSI extreme and divergence).\n- Trend-following entry: would require a pullback in the direction of the trend with clear structure and acceptable R:R to a logical target. From ~4224, a reasonable bullish SL would be below 4210 support, and TP around 4240. That\u2019s about:\n  - SL distance: ~14 points\n  - TP distance: ~16 points\n  - R:R \u2248 16/14 \u2248 1.14:1, which is below the 1.5 minimum.\n  - For a tighter SL (e.g., under 4215 minor pivot), invalidation is structurally weak; price could easily spike there without breaking the trend, so that would violate our \u201cSL at clear invalidation\u201d rule.\n\nThus, any immediate BUY from current price fails the R:R gatekeeper when using proper structure.\n\nSimilarly, a SELL from here with SL above 4240 and TP at 4210 gives:\n- SL distance: ~16 points\n- TP distance: ~14 points\n- R:R \u2248 0.9:1, also below minimum and counter to the mild uptrend.\n\n6) Checkpoints before any trade\n\nCheckpoint 1: Post-Loss Cooldown\n- No recent realized loss or closed position in this cycle.\n- Not in a post-loss lockout. \u2192 PASS\n\nCheckpoint 2: R:R Gatekeeper\n- Any structurally sound trade from current price (mid-range) gives R:R < 1.5:1.\n- Edge-based trades (buy near 4210, sell near 4240) are not currently available because price is not at those levels.\n- Therefore, any immediate trade would violate the R:R requirement. \u2192 FAIL\n\nBecause Checkpoint 2 fails, we must HOLD and wait for a better location (either a retest of 4210 support or 4240 resistance, or a clearer breakout structure).\n\nCheckpoint 3 (risk sizing) is not reached because we stop at Checkpoint 2.\n\nConclusion:\n- Market is moderately trending up within a defined intraday range.\n- Current price is mid-range, with no valid high-R:R setup according to our structural and indicator rules.\n- Capital preservation directive plus R:R gatekeeper both argue for patience here.\n\nNo trades will be executed this cycle.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 20%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Price is mid-range in a moderate uptrend and any structurally sound trade from current level fails the minimum 1.5:1 R:R requirement, so rules dictate no entry."

    "content": "Market analysis:\n\n1) Price action and tempo\n- Latest 15m candle (14:31): open 4227.06, high 4241.5, low 4222.21, close 4222.98, volume 3319.\n- Today\u2019s range: high 4241.5, low 4194.33 (~47 points), similar to last cycle.\n- Structure today:\n  - Steady climb from ~4194 to 4241.5.\n  - The last candle shows a strong spike to a new high (4241.5) and then a rejection back down to ~4223.\n- Relative to recent 15m candles, this last bar is large in range (about 19 points) and has a long upper wick \u2192 sign of profit-taking / selling pressure at the highs.\n- Still, the broader move from yesterday\u2019s 4170s is up; we are in an uptrend with a rejection at the current intraday high.\n\nTempo classification: MODERATE to edging toward HIGH on that last candle (larger range, new high, rejection). However, price is not in a clean runaway breakout; it\u2019s more like a spike and rejection at resistance.\n\n2) Indicators\n- MACD (minute):\n  - Recent MACD values positive, but signal line is higher and histogram has just turned sharply negative.\n  - This indicates bullish momentum peaked and is now weakening; short-term momentum is rolling over from the upside.\n- RSI (minute, 14):\n  - Latest values: around 40\u201352.\n  - RSI was higher (mid-50s to high-50s) before the spike and has now dropped toward 40.\n  - No overbought extreme (>70), but the drop from mid-50s to low-40s aligns with the rejection at the highs.\n\n3) Market structure / levels\n- Key intraday support: ~4205\u20134210 (multiple touches earlier today).\n- Key resistance: ~4240\u20134242 (today\u2019s high cluster; the latest candle wicked to 4241.5 and closed back near 4223).\n- Current price: about 4223 (slightly above mid-range between 4210 support and 4240 resistance, but closer to the middle than to either edge).\n- Trend: Still up on a multi-hour view, but the latest candle shows clear rejection at resistance.\n\n4) Account and positions\n- Open positions: None.\n- Balance: $88.44.\n- No SL/TP events since last cycle.\n- Risk tier: Balance < $100 \u2192 max risk 20% per trade, with small-account override allowing 0.01 lot if risk \u2264 $20.\n\n5) Strategy assessment\n\nWe must align with our rules:\n\n- Tempo: MODERATE, with a sharp rejection candle at resistance.\n- For MODERATE tempo:\n  - We can range trade (fade edges) if:\n    - Entry is at/near the edge.\n    - R:R \u2265 2:1.\n    - Stop is tight and structural.\n  - Counter-trend mid-range entries require RSI extreme + MACD divergence + structural retest; not present here.\n\nCurrent location:\n- Price is around 4223, while:\n  - Clear resistance is ~4240.\n  - Clear support is ~4210.\n- We are not at resistance (for a high-probability short) nor at support (for a high-probability long).\n- A trend-following long from 4223 with SL below 4210 and TP near 4240 gives:\n  - SL distance \u2248 13 points.\n  - TP distance \u2248 17 points.\n  - R:R \u2248 17/13 \u2248 1.3:1, below the required 1.5:1.\n- A short from 4223 with SL above 4242 and TP at 4210 gives:\n  - SL distance \u2248 19 points.\n  - TP distance \u2248 13 points.\n  - R:R \u2248 13/19 \u2248 0.68:1, also unacceptable and counter to the broader uptrend.\n\nEdge trades:\n- A SELL at ~4240 with SL just above the high (e.g., 4244) and TP at ~4210:\n  - SL distance \u2248 4 points.\n  - TP distance \u2248 30 points.\n  - R:R \u2248 7.5:1 (excellent).\n  - But price is no longer there; the opportunity would be to wait for a retest, not to enter now.\n- A BUY at ~4210 with SL below ~4204 and TP at ~4240:\n  - SL distance \u2248 6 points.\n  - TP distance \u2248 30 points.\n  - R:R \u2248 5:1 (also excellent).\n  - Again, we must wait for price to come to the level.\n\nOur rules explicitly: \u201cEntry is AT the level (not chasing).\u201d From 4223, both long and short would be chasing away from the optimal edges and produce substandard R:R.\n\n6) Checkpoints before any trade\n\nCheckpoint 1: Post-Loss Cooldown\n- No loss since last cycle; no open/closed trades.\n- Not in washout. \u2192 PASS\n\nCheckpoint 2: R:R Gatekeeper\n- Any immediate BUY or SELL from current 4223 area, using logical structural SL/TP, yields R:R < 1.5:1.\n- Valid high-R:R setups exist only at the edges (near 4210 or 4240), and price is not there.\n- Therefore, R:R condition for an immediate trade is NOT met. \u2192 FAIL\n\nSince Checkpoint 2 fails, we must not proceed to risk sizing or execution.\n\nConclusion:\n- The market is still in an intraday uptrend but has just rejected from new highs.\n- Current price is mid-range, not at a structural edge.\n- Any trade from here would violate our R:R gate and/or structure rules.\n- Capital preservation and rule adherence require patience and waiting for price to reach 4210 support or 4240 resistance before considering entries.\n\nNo trade will be executed this cycle.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 20%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Price is mid-range between 4210 support and 4240 resistance and any structurally sound trade from current level fails the minimum 1.5:1 R:R requirement, so rules mandate no entry."

The nearest strong invalidation is far above (above 4240), but that\u2019s too wide for this account. More realistically, above a recent lower high (e.g., ~4225\u20134230), but that\u2019s not a clean, confirmed swing yet.\n- Logical TP: next meaningful liquidity pool below current support, e.g., near today\u2019s low around 4194 or slightly below.\n\nExample 1 (conservative structure):\n- Entry: 4209\n- SL: 4225 (above immediate minor resistance formed by the last bounce area)\n- TP: 4194 (retest of today\u2019s low)\n- SL distance: 4225 - 4209 = 16 points\n- TP distance: 4209 - 4194 = 15 points\n- R:R \u2248 15/16 \u2248 0.94:1 \u2192 fails R:R gatekeeper.\n\nExample 2 (more aggressive TP):\n- Entry: 4209\n- SL: 4225\n- TP: 4185 (targeting a deeper push below today\u2019s low)\n- SL distance: 16 points\n- TP distance: 4209 - 4185 = 24 points\n- R:R = 24/16 = 1.5:1 \u2192 just meets the minimum.\n\nBut:\n- TP at 4185 is below today\u2019s low (4194), requiring a decisive break of strong support on the first test of 4205\u20134210. That\u2019s possible in high tempo, but:\n  - We are entering right on support, not after a clear break and retest.\n  - RSI is oversold; this increases the chance of a bounce or at least a consolidation at this level.\n  - Structurally, a cleaner short would be:\n    - Either after a confirmed break below 4194 and a retest from underneath (selling a pullback),\n    - Or from a lower high after a bounce away from support.\n\nGiven the Prime Directive (capital preservation) and the explicit rule against counter-trend trades in high tempo:\n- Directionally, a SELL aligns with intraday momentum.\n- But we are at support with oversold RSI, and the only way to achieve acceptable R:R is to assume a fresh breakdown through today\u2019s low on the first test. That is an aggressive assumption not clearly supported by structure yet.\n\n6) Checkpoints before any trade\n\nCheckpoint 1: Post-Loss Cooldown\n- No recent loss; not in cooldown. \u2192 PASS\n\nCheckpoint 2: R:R Gatekeeper\n- For a structurally sound trade, SL must be at a clear invalidation level and TP at a logical next liquidity zone.\n- The conservative TP at today\u2019s low (4194) gives R:R < 1.5:1.\n- Extending TP to 4185 gives R:R \u2248 1.5:1, but this TP is speculative (requires a fresh breakdown below today\u2019s low on first touch of support).\n- Given we are selling directly into a known support band with oversold RSI, that TP is not a \u201cnext logical\u201d level in the sense of our rules; it is one step beyond the obvious liquidity pool.\n- Therefore, by strict structural standards, the valid TP is 4194, and that yields R:R \u2248 0.94:1 \u2192 below the 1.5 minimum.\n\nSo Checkpoint 2 fails for any conservative, structure-respecting short from current price.\n\nWhen Checkpoint 2 fails:\n- We must output the failure and HOLD.\n\nCheckpoint 3 (risk sizing) is not reached.\n\nConclusion:\n- High-tempo bearish move into a strong support zone with oversold RSI.\n- Trend-following SELL is allowed in principle but not from this exact location because:\n  - We are at support.\n  - R:R to the next logical target (today\u2019s low) is < 1.5:1.\n- Our rules and capital preservation mandate require skipping this marginal, structurally compromised setup and waiting for:\n  - Either a clear break below 4194 and retest (then sell),\n  - Or a bounce back up to form a lower high (then sell from higher, with better R:R).\n\nNo trade will be executed this cycle.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 20%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Despite high bearish tempo, price is sitting on strong 4205\u20134210 support and any structurally sound short from here fails the 1.5:1 R:R requirement, so rules and capital preservation dictate no entry."

    "content": "Market analysis:\n\n1) Price action and tempo\n- Latest 15m candle (15:03): open 4206.84, high 4222.03, low 4206.53, close 4220.88, volume 3069.\n- This follows a prior candle (14:48) that sold off from 4224.9 down to ~4206.8 (test of the 4205\u20134210 support).\n- The latest candle is a strong bullish response off that support: near-equal open/low and a close near the high \u2192 clear rejection of lower prices.\n- Daily range: high 4241.5, low 4194.33 (~47 points). Current price 4220.9 is in the upper half of the range but below the high.\n- Overall intraday structure: Uptrend from yesterday\u2019s 4170s, push to 4241.5, pullback to 4205 support, now a bounce.\n\nTempo classification: MODERATE (the violent selloff has cooled, and we\u2019re seeing responsive buying off support rather than a continued waterfall).\n\n2) Indicators\n- MACD (minute):\n  - MACD values are still negative but rising toward the signal line; histogram has flipped positive and is increasing.\n  - This indicates bearish momentum is fading and bullish momentum is emerging after the pullback.\n- RSI (minute, 14):\n  - Latest RSI ~58 (was in mid-40s to low-50s earlier).\n  - No overbought/oversold extremes; momentum is now mildly bullish.\n\n3) Market structure / levels\n- Key support: 4205\u20134210 (just tested and held on the 14:48 candle).\n- Key resistance: 4240\u20134242 (today\u2019s high and prior rejection zone).\n- Current price: 4220.9, above support and below resistance.\n- Structure: Higher-timeframe uptrend; recent pullback respected support and is now bouncing.\n\n4) Account and positions\n- Open positions: None.\n- Balance: $88.44.\n- Risk tier: Balance < $100 \u2192 max risk 20% per trade, with small-account override permitting 0.01 lot risk up to $20.\n\n5) Strategy application\n\nTempo: MODERATE \u2192 Range trading allowed; trend-following also acceptable if structure and R:R align.\n\nBias: Bullish.\n- We have:\n  - Higher-timeframe uptrend.\n  - Successful defense of 4205\u20134210 support.\n  - Bullish reversal candle off support.\n  - MACD turning up, RSI rising.\n\nThis favors a LONG (BUY) bias.\n\nHowever, we must check if a long from current price gives acceptable R:R with structural SL/TP.\n\nCandidate long setup:\n- Entry: around 4221.\n- SL: below the recent swing low / support at 4205. A reasonable invalidation could be 4203 (below the 4205\u20134210 band to allow noise).\n  - SL distance \u2248 4221 - 4203 = 18 points.\n- TP: logical next liquidity/resistance is the 4240\u20134242 zone (today\u2019s high).\n  - TP distance \u2248 4240 - 4221 = 19 points.\n\nR:R calculation:\n- R:R \u2248 19 / 18 \u2248 1.06:1 \u2192 below the minimum 1.5:1.\n\nIf we tighten SL to improve R:R:\n- Suppose SL at 4208 (just under the bounce origin).\n  - SL distance = 4221 - 4208 = 13 points.\n  - TP still at 4240 (19 points).\n  - R:R \u2248 19 / 13 \u2248 1.46:1 \u2192 still slightly below 1.5:1, and SL is not at a clear structural invalidation (price can easily retest 4210 without breaking the uptrend), which violates our SL rule.\n\nWe could extend TP above 4240 to force R:R \u2265 1.5, but:\n- 4240\u20134242 is the clear, recent swing high and obvious liquidity pool.\n- Pushing TP significantly beyond it without fresh breakout confirmation would be arbitrary and against the \u201cmarket structure-based TP\u201d rule.\n\nTherefore, any structurally honest long from current price fails the R:R gate.\n\nShort side:\n- A SELL here would be counter to the current bounce from support and the broader uptrend.\n- Also, with SL above 4242 and TP back to support, the R:R would be poor.\n- In MODERATE tempo we can fade ranges, but shorting from mid-range (4221) toward 4205 with SL above 4242 would give:\n  - SL distance \u2248 4242 - 4221 = 21.\n  - TP distance \u2248 4221 - 4205 = 16.\n  - R:R \u2248 16 / 21 \u2248 0.76:1 \u2192 unacceptable, plus counter to trend and structure.\n\n6) Checkpoints before any trade\n\nCheckpoint 1: Post-Loss Cooldown\n- No recent loss; not in lockout. \u2192 PASS\n\nCheckpoint 2: R:R Gatekeeper\n- Best structurally valid BUY from current price (SL below 4205, TP at 4240) yields R:R \u2248 1.06:1.\n- Any tighter SL either:\n  - Is not at structural invalidation, or\n  - Still fails to reach 1.5:1.\n- Any SELL from here is both structurally weak and yields R:R < 1.5:1.\n- Therefore: REJECTED: R:R < 1.5:1 minimum. \u2192 FAIL\n\nSince Checkpoint 2 fails, we do not proceed to risk sizing or execution.\n\nConclusion:\n- Market is bullishly bouncing from key support with indicators turning up, but the current price is such that a structurally sound long cannot achieve R:R \u2265 1.5:1 to the next logical resistance.\n- Shorting is both structurally and mathematically poor.\n- The correct action is to HOLD and wait for either:\n  - A deeper pullback closer to 4208\u20134210 to improve long R:R, or\n  - A breakout and retest above 4240 for a trend continuation entry.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 20%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Bullish bounce from support is underway but any structurally sound long from current price fails the 1.5:1 R:R requirement and shorts are both weak and low R:R, so no trade is justified."

    "content": "Market analysis:\n\n1) Price action and tempo\n- Latest 15m candle (15:19): open 4223.11, high 4227.16, low 4217.86, close 4226.23, volume 2557.\n- Previous candle (15:04): open 4212.27, low 4212.27, high 4224.28, close 4223.07 \u2013 strong bullish candle from just above the 4210 area.\n- Earlier today: push to 4241.5, pullback to around 4205 support, then a sequence of higher lows and now a push back into the 4220s.\n- Daily range: high 4241.5, low 4194.33 (~47 points). Current price ~4226 is in the upper half of the range but below the high.\n- Recent candles show strong, consistent buying from ~4210 to ~4225 with decent ranges and volumes.\n\nTempo classification: MODERATE to moderately HIGH bullish tempo (sustained upside momentum but not an explosive breakout through 4241 yet).\n\n2) Indicators\n- MACD (minute):\n  - MACD is positive and above the signal line; histogram is positive and healthy.\n  - This confirms bullish momentum accelerating.\n- RSI (minute, 14):\n  - Latest RSI \u2248 65 (recent values mostly 55\u201360+).\n  - Approaching overbought but not yet extreme (>70). Indicates strong bullish pressure but not necessarily exhausted.\n\n3) Market structure / levels\n- Key support: 4205\u20134210 (held multiple times; recent low 4217.86 in last candle is a higher low above that).\n- Intermediate support: ~4215\u20134220 (recent consolidation before the latest push).\n- Key resistance: 4240\u20134242 (today\u2019s high and prior rejection zone).\n- Current price: ~4226, between intermediate support (4215\u20134220) and resistance (4240\u20134242).\n- Trend: Uptrend from yesterday\u2019s lows is intact; recent pullback respected support and buyers are in control again.\n\n4) Account and positions\n- Open positions: None.\n- Balance: $88.44.\n- Risk tier: Balance < $100 \u2192 max risk 20% per trade, with small-account override allowing 0.01 lot risk up to $20.\n\n5) Strategy assessment\n\nTempo: MODERATE/HIGH and bullish.\n- In HIGH tempo we only trade with the trend (no counter-trend shorts).\n- Directional bias: BULLISH (confirmed by structure and indicators).\n\nWe therefore only consider BUY setups.\n\nHowever, they must satisfy:\n- SL at structural invalidation.\n- TP at next logical liquidity/resistance.\n- R:R \u2265 1.5:1.\n\nCandidate long from current ~4226:\n\nOption A (structurally conservative):\n- Entry: 4226.\n- SL: below the main support band 4205\u20134210. A reasonable invalidation: 4203 (below 4205 to allow noise).\n  - SL distance = 4226 - 4203 = 23 points.\n- TP: at the key resistance 4241 (today\u2019s high).\n  - TP distance = 4241 - 4226 = 15 points.\n- R:R \u2248 15 / 23 \u2248 0.65:1 \u2192 fails badly.\n\nOption B (tighter SL at intermediate support):\n- Entry: 4226.\n- SL: below recent higher low / local support around 4217\u20134218. Suppose SL at 4216.\n  - SL distance = 4226 - 4216 = 10 points.\n- TP: at 4241 (key resistance).\n  - TP distance = 15 points.\n- R:R = 15 / 10 = 1.5:1 \u2013 hits the bare minimum.\n\nBut:\n- Is 4216 a clear invalidation? Structure shows:\n  - Stronger, more tested support at 4205\u20134210.\n  - 4217.86 is just the low of the last candle, a very recent swing that has only been tested once.\n- Price can easily retest 4217\u20134218 without breaking the broader uptrend or invalidating the bullish structure; the true structural invalidation is still below 4205\u20134210.\n- Using 4216 as SL would mean putting the stop in the middle of the local range, not beyond a true structural low, violating our SL rule.\n\nOption C (force higher TP to improve R:R):\n- Entry: 4226, SL: 4203 (structural), TP: 4250+ to get R:R \u2265 1.5.\n- But the next obvious liquidity pool is at 4240\u20134242. Extending TP significantly beyond that without a breakout structure is arbitrary and not justified by current price action.\n\nTherefore, any structurally honest long from 4226 cannot achieve R:R \u2265 1.5:1 to the next logical resistance.\n\nShort side:\n- Shorts would be counter to the current bullish momentum and the broader uptrend.\n- Also, from 4226 with SL above 4242 and TP back to 4210:\n  - SL distance \u2248 4242 - 4226 = 16.\n  - TP distance \u2248 4226 - 4210 = 16.\n  - R:R \u2248 1:1, and direction is against the trend \u2192 invalid under our rules, especially with tempo elevated.\n\n6) Checkpoints before any trade\n\nCheckpoint 1: Post-Loss Cooldown\n- No recent losses; not in lockout. \u2192 PASS\n\nCheckpoint 2: R:R Gatekeeper\n- Best structurally valid BUY (SL below 4205, TP at 4241) yields R:R \u2248 0.65:1.\n- Tighter SLs that would give R:R \u2248 1.5:1 are not at clear structural invalidation and therefore not allowed.\n- Any SELL is counter-trend and low R:R.\n- REJECTED: R:R < 1.5:1 minimum for all structurally sound setups from current price. \u2192 FAIL\n\nSince Checkpoint 2 fails, we do not proceed to risk sizing or trade execution.\n\nConclusion:\n- Market is bullish with strong momentum and price pushing higher, but current location between support and resistance does not offer a structurally sound entry with R:R \u2265 1.5:1.\n- Buying here would be chasing; shorting would be counter-trend.\n- Capital preservation and rule adherence require waiting for:\n  - Either a pullback closer to 4215\u20134218 or 4205\u20134210 to improve long R:R, or\n  - A confirmed breakout and retest above 4241 for continuation.\n\nNo trade will be executed this cycle.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 20%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Bullish momentum is strong but current price is mid-zone between support and 4240 resistance, and any structurally valid trade from here fails the \u22651.5:1 R:R rule, so no entry is justified."

    "content": "Market analysis:\n\n1) Price action and tempo\n- Latest 15m candle (15:35): open 4228.69, high 4229.22, low 4225.30, close 4226.26, volume 2369.\n- Previous candle (15:20): strong bullish bar from 4217.86 to 4228.71.\n- Sequence: After testing the 4205\u20134210 support earlier, price has pushed back up into the 4220s and briefly into the high 4220s.\n- Daily range: high 4241.5, low 4194.33 (~47 points). Current price ~4226 is in the upper half of the range, still below the intraday high.\n- Recent candles show a push up, then slight stalling just under 4230; no decisive breakout or reversal.\n\nTempo classification: MODERATE (good movement, but not a high-volatility breakout; candles are not exploding beyond prior ranges).\n\n2) Indicators\n- MACD (minute):\n  - MACD values are positive and above the zero line; however, the signal line is slightly higher and the histogram has recently turned mildly negative.\n  - This suggests bullish momentum is still present but has started to cool/flatten.\n- RSI (minute, 14):\n  - Latest RSI around 54\u201356.\n  - Neutral to mildly bullish; no overbought/oversold extremes.\n\n3) Market structure / levels\n- Key support: 4205\u20134210 (tested multiple times today; holds as the main intraday floor).\n- Intermediate support: ~4217\u20134220 (recent pivot area before the last push).\n- Key resistance: 4240\u20134242 (today\u2019s high and repeated rejection zone).\n- Current price: ~4226, between intermediate support and major resistance.\n- Trend: Uptrend from yesterday remains intact; intraday we are in a bullish channel, but currently trading mid-zone rather than at an edge.\n\n4) Account and positions\n- Open positions: None.\n- Balance: $88.44.\n- Risk tier: Balance < $100 \u2192 max risk 20% per trade, with 0.01 lot allowed if risk \u2264 $20.\n\n5) Strategy assessment\n\nTempo: MODERATE, bias: BULLISH (structure and indicators).\n\nWe only want BUY setups in line with the trend unless a very strong, structured counter-trend case appears, which we do not have here.\n\nWe must check if a long from current price can meet our structural and R:R rules.\n\nCandidate long from ~4226:\n\nA) Conservative structural SL (below main support):\n- Entry: 4226.\n- SL: below 4205\u20134210 support, e.g., 4203.\n  - SL distance = 4226 - 4203 = 23 points.\n- TP: at the next logical resistance 4241 (today\u2019s high).\n  - TP distance = 4241 - 4226 = 15 points.\n- R:R \u2248 15 / 23 \u2248 0.65:1 \u2192 fails clearly.\n\nB) Tighter SL at intermediate support:\n- Entry: 4226.\n- SL: below recent local support 4217\u20134218, say 4216.\n  - SL distance = 4226 - 4216 = 10 points.\n- TP: at 4241.\n  - TP distance = 15 points.\n- R:R = 15 / 10 = 1.5:1, just at the minimum.\n\nBut structurally:\n- 4216 is not a robust, multi-tested swing low; it\u2019s just a nearby intrabar low.\n- True structure has repeatedly shown 4205\u20134210 as the real invalidation zone for the broader move.\n- Using 4216 as SL puts the stop inside the current trading range rather than beyond a clear invalidation, violating our SL placement rule.\n\nC) Forcing higher TP:\n- Entry: 4226, SL: 4203, TP > 4250 to get R:R \u2265 1.5:1.\n- But 4240\u20134242 is the obvious liquidity pool and resistance; setting TP significantly above it without a breakout structure is arbitrary and not allowed by our market-structure TP rule.\n\nShort side:\n- A SELL from here would be counter to the broader uptrend and recent bullish push from support.\n- Structure: We\u2019re below 4240 resistance, but not at it; shorting from 4226 with SL above 4242 and TP at 4210 yields:\n  - SL distance \u2248 4242 - 4226 = 16.\n  - TP distance \u2248 4226 - 4210 = 16.\n  - R:R \u2248 1:1, and direction is counter-trend \u2192 invalid.\n\n6) Checkpoints before any trade\n\nCheckpoint 1: Post-Loss Cooldown\n- No recent losses; not in washout. \u2192 PASS\n\nCheckpoint 2: R:R Gatekeeper\n- Any structurally honest BUY from current price (SL below 4205, TP at 4241) yields R:R \u2248 0.65:1.\n- Tighter SLs that achieve R:R \u2248 1.5:1 are not at true structural invalidation.\n- Any SELL is counter-trend and has poor R:R.\n- Therefore: REJECTED: R:R < 1.5:1 minimum for all valid setups from current level. \u2192 FAIL\n\nSince Checkpoint 2 fails, we must HOLD and not proceed to lot sizing or execution.\n\nConclusion:\n- Market remains bullish and above key support, but current price is mid-zone between strong support and resistance.\n- There is no entry that simultaneously respects structural SL/TP placement and achieves R:R \u2265 1.5:1.\n- Capital preservation and rule adherence require waiting for:\n  - A pullback closer to 4217\u20134220 or 4205\u20134210 to buy with better R:R, or\n  - A confirmed breakout and retest above 4241 for continuation.\n\nNo trade will be executed this cycle.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 20%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Price is mid-zone in a bullish structure and any structurally valid trade from here fails the \u22651.5:1 R:R rule, so no entry is justified."

    "content": "Market analysis:\n\n1) Price action and tempo\n- Latest 15m candle (15:50): open 4226.17, high 4226.17, low 4213.99, close 4220.68, volume 2766.\n- This follows:\n  - A push up to ~4229 (15:35, 15:20), then\n  - A pullback to ~4214 and close back around 4221.\n- Daily range: high 4241.5, low 4194.33 (~47 points). Current price ~4221 is in the upper half of the day\u2019s range, still below the high.\n- Intraday structure: Uptrend from yesterday remains intact, but in the last few candles we see:\n  - Failure to retest or break 4241.\n  - Lower high around 4229 vs earlier 4241.\n  - Mild pullback from those intraday highs.\n\nTempo classification: MODERATE. Candles have decent ranges but are not explosive; we are not in a runaway breakout or crash.\n\n2) Indicators\n- MACD (minute):\n  - MACD is negative and below the signal line; histogram is negative (bearish).\n  - This indicates short-term downside momentum after the recent local high near 4229.\n- RSI (minute, 14):\n  - Latest RSI \u2248 48\u201350 (recently dipped to low 30s during the drop, then bounced).\n  - Currently neutral; no overbought/oversold extreme.\n\n3) Market structure / levels\n- Key support: 4205\u20134210 (strong, repeatedly tested intraday floor).\n- Recent low this candle: 4213.99 \u2013 a higher low above that key band.\n- Key resistance: 4240\u20134242 (today\u2019s high and clear rejection zone).\n- Intermediate resistance: ~4228\u20134230 (recent local high before this pullback).\n- Current price: ~4221, between support (4205\u20134210) and resistance (4240\u20134242).\n- Trend: Higher-timeframe uptrend; very short-term, a small corrective move from ~4229 back toward 4220.\n\n4) Account and positions\n- Open positions: None.\n- Balance: $88.44.\n- Risk tier: Balance < $100 \u2192 max risk 20% per trade, with 0.01 lot allowed if risk \u2264 $20.\n\n5) Strategy assessment\n\nTempo: MODERATE.\nDirectional bias: Still BULLISH on the larger intraday structure (higher lows, above main support), but immediate momentum is mildly bearish (MACD negative after failing to push higher).\n\nIn MODERATE tempo:\n- Range trading is allowed (buy support / sell resistance) if:\n  - Entry is at the edge.\n  - R:R \u2265 2:1 (strict).\n- Counter-trend mid-range trades require strong confluence (RSI extreme, MACD divergence, structural retest) \u2013 which we do not have right now.\n\nCurrent location is mid-range:\n- Above strong support (4205\u20134210).\n- Below strong resistance (4240\u20134242).\n- Not at an edge.\n\nCheck potential setups:\n\nA) Long (trend-following) from current ~4221:\n- Logical SL: below the main support band 4205\u20134210, e.g., 4203.\n  - SL distance = 4221 - 4203 = 18 points.\n- Logical TP: at 4241 (prior high / resistance).\n  - TP distance = 4241 - 4221 = 20 points.\n- R:R \u2248 20 / 18 \u2248 1.11:1 \u2192 fails the 1.5:1 minimum.\n\nTightening SL to improve R:R:\n- SL at 4210 (just below recent low 4213.99).\n  - SL distance = 4221 - 4210 = 11 points.\n  - TP at 4241 \u2192 TP distance = 20 points.\n  - R:R \u2248 20 / 11 \u2248 1.82:1 (acceptable numerically).\n- But structurally:\n  - 4210 is part of the key support band, not clearly below it; price can easily spike there and still remain in the uptrend.\n  - Our SL rule requires placement beyond clear invalidation; that is closer to 4203\u20134205.\n  - Using 4210 as SL is putting the stop in the \u201cnoise\u201d zone, which violates the structural SL rule.\n\nSo a long from here either:\n- Uses proper structural SL and fails R:R, or\n- Uses non-structural SL to force R:R, which is not allowed.\n\nB) Short (counter-trend) from current ~4221:\n- This would be against the broader uptrend and above main support.\n- To short, we\u2019d want to be at resistance (~4240) or after a clear breakdown below support.\n- From 4221 with SL above 4242 and TP at 4210:\n  - SL distance \u2248 4242 - 4221 = 21.\n  - TP distance \u2248 4221 - 4210 = 11.\n  - R:R \u2248 11 / 21 \u2248 0.52:1 \u2192 unacceptable and counter-trend.\n\nThus, no valid short either.\n\n6) Checkpoints before any trade\n\nCheckpoint 1: Post-Loss Cooldown\n- No recent loss; not in lockout. \u2192 PASS\n\nCheckpoint 2: R:R Gatekeeper\n- Any structurally sound BUY from current price (SL below 4205, TP at 4241) yields R:R \u2248 1.11:1 (<1.5).\n- Any SELL is counter-trend and also low R:R.\n- Tightening SL to get R:R \u2265 1.5 would break the structural SL rule.\n- REJECTED: R:R < 1.5:1 minimum for all structurally valid setups from current level. \u2192 FAIL\n\nSince Checkpoint 2 fails, we do not proceed to risk sizing or execution.\n\nConclusion:\n- Market remains broadly bullish but is currently in a mid-range consolidation between 4205\u20134210 support and 4240\u20134242 resistance.\n- Immediate momentum is mixed (MACD bearish, price still above support).\n- No trade from current price satisfies both structural SL/TP placement and the \u22651.5:1 R:R requirement.\n- The correct move is to HOLD, waiting for:\n  - A pullback closer to 4205\u20134210 (for a better long R:R), or\n  - A breakout and retest above 4241 for continuation, or\n  - A clear breakdown and retest below 4205 if a trend change emerges.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 20%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Price is mid-range between strong support and resistance; any structurally valid trade from here fails the \u22651.5:1 R:R rule, so no entry is justified."

    "content": "Market analysis:\n\n1) Price action and tempo\n- Latest 15m candle (16:06): open 4220.26, high 4220.85, low 4214.51, close 4215.44, volume 2461.\n- Recent sequence:\n  - 15:21\u201315:36: price pushed up toward ~4228\u20134229.\n  - 15:51\u201316:06: price has drifted lower from ~4220 to ~4215 after failing to sustain above ~4228.\n- Daily range: high 4241.5, low 4194.33 (~47 points). Current price ~4215 is near the middle of this range.\n- Structure today: Uptrend from prior sessions, but intraday we\u2019ve seen repeated failures to break 4241 and now a mild pullback off intraday highs.\n- Candle ranges are moderate; no explosive breakout or crash.\n\nTempo classification: MODERATE. Price is moving within a defined band without high-tempo spikes.\n\n2) Indicators\n- MACD (minute):\n  - MACD is negative and slightly below its signal line; histogram is small and slightly negative.\n  - This suggests mild bearish bias / consolidation after earlier selling, but not strong momentum.\n- RSI (minute, 14):\n  - Latest RSI ~41.\n  - Neutral to slightly bearish; no oversold (<30) or overbought (>70) conditions.\n\n3) Market structure / levels\n- Key support: 4205\u20134210 (tested multiple times; still holding).\n- Current price: ~4215, just above that main support band.\n- Key resistance: 4240\u20134242 (today\u2019s high and repeated rejection area).\n- Intermediate resistance: ~4228\u20134230 (recent local high before this pullback).\n- Trend: Higher-timeframe uptrend remains intact; intraday we are in a sideways-to-mildly-down consolidation between 4205\u20134210 and 4228\u20134241.\n\n4) Account and positions\n- Open positions: None.\n- Balance: $88.44.\n- Risk tier: Balance < $100 \u2192 max risk 20% per trade, with small-account override allowing 0.01 lot risk up to $20.\n\n5) Strategy assessment\n\nTempo: MODERATE.\nBias: Structurally still BULLISH (above 4205\u20134210), but immediate momentum is soft.\n\nIn MODERATE tempo:\n- Range trading is allowed (buy support / sell resistance) at the edges with R:R \u2265 2:1.\n- Counter-trend mid-range trades require strong confluence (RSI extreme, MACD divergence, structural retest), which we do not have.\n\nCurrent location:\n- Price ~4215 is slightly above the main support zone but not at the exact edge (4205\u20134210).\n- We are mid-band between strong support (4205\u20134210) and resistance (4240\u20134242).\n\nCheck potential setups:\n\nA) Long near current price (~4215):\n- Logical SL: below 4205\u20134210 support band, e.g., 4202\u20134203.\n  - Take SL = 4203 \u2192 SL distance = 4215 - 4203 = 12 points.\n- Logical TP: at 4241 (prior high / resistance).\n  - TP distance = 4241 - 4215 = 26 points.\n- R:R \u2248 26 / 12 \u2248 2.17:1 (good).\n\nBut structurally:\n- The true support band is 4205\u20134210. We are 5\u201310 points above that; an entry at 4215 is not \u201cat the level\u201d per our range-trading rule.\n- Our rules: \u201cEntry is AT the level (not chasing).\u201d Here, the optimal buy zone is closer to 4208\u20134210 or lower, not 4215.\n- Entering now is effectively buying mid-range above support; the attractive R:R is partly due to not yet having reached the ideal entry zone.\n\nIf we insist on entry at the edge:\n- Ideal long would be:\n  - Entry: 4210\n  - SL: 4202\u20134203\n  - TP: 4241\n  - That would yield excellent R:R and respect structure. But price is not there yet.\n\nB) Short from current price (~4215):\n- This would be counter to the broader uptrend and above main support.\n- To short, we\u2019d prefer being at resistance (~4240) or after a breakdown below 4205 with a retest.\n- From 4215 with SL above 4242 and TP at 4205:\n  - SL distance \u2248 4242 - 4215 = 27.\n  - TP distance \u2248 4215 - 4205 = 10.\n  - R:R \u2248 10 / 27 \u2248 0.37:1 \u2192 unacceptable and counter-trend.\n\nNo valid short setup.\n\n6) Checkpoints before any trade\n\nCheckpoint 1: Post-Loss Cooldown\n- No recent loss; no open/closed trades. \u2192 PASS\n\nCheckpoint 2: R:R Gatekeeper\n- If we respect the \u201centry at the level\u201d rule, the valid long entry is at/near 4205\u20134210, not at 4215.\n- From the actual current price (4215), we are not at the structural support edge; entering now would be chasing, even if the theoretical R:R using distant support looks good.\n- Our framework treats this as not a valid edge trade. For mid-range entries, we then need:\n  - RSI extreme (<30 or >70) \u2013 not present (RSI ~41).\n  - MACD divergence \u2013 not evident from current tool output.\n  - Structural retest with multiple rejections \u2013 not clearly defined at 4215.\n- Therefore, there is no structurally valid setup from the current price that satisfies both the edge rule and R:R criteria.\n\nResult: REJECTED: No valid setup at current price that meets structural rules and R:R \u2265 1.5:1. \u2192 FAIL\n\nSince Checkpoint 2 fails, we do not proceed to risk sizing or execution.\n\nConclusion:\n- Market is consolidating just above key support in a broader uptrend.\n- Current price is slightly above the ideal buy zone and far from resistance, with neutral indicators.\n- By our rules, we must wait for price either to:\n  - Test the 4205\u20134210 support region for a high-R:R long, or\n  - Break and retest above 4241 for continuation, or\n  - Break and retest below 4205 for a structural shift.\n\nNo trade is justified this cycle.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 20%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Price is slightly above but not at key 4205\u20134210 support and far from 4240 resistance; no setup from current level satisfies both structural edge rules and the \u22651.5:1 R:R requirement, so no entry is taken."

    "content": "Market analysis:\n\n1) Price action and tempo\n- Latest 15m candle (16:22): open 4214.56, high 4223.42, low 4213.90, close 4222.23, volume 2419.\n- This candle is a strong bullish bar: it opened near the lows and closed near the highs, pushing away from the 4214 area.\n- Recent sequence:\n  - 16:07: small-bodied candle around 4214 after a mild dip.\n  - 16:22: impulsive move up to ~4222\u20134223.\n- Daily context: high 4241.5, low 4194.33 (~47 points). Current price ~4222 is in the upper half of the range but still below the day\u2019s high.\n- Structure: The broader trend from yesterday remains up. Today we\u2019ve repeatedly failed to break 4241 but continue to hold above 4205\u20134210 support, with price oscillating between ~4210 and ~4230+.\n\nTempo classification: MODERATE with a fresh bullish impulse. Candles are not extreme in size but show clear directional intent in this last move.\n\n2) Indicators\n- MACD (minute):\n  - MACD is now positive and above the signal line; histogram is strongly positive and rising.\n  - This indicates bullish momentum has reasserted after a brief dip.\n- RSI (minute, 14):\n  - Latest RSI \u2248 63\u201366.\n  - Momentum is bullish, approaching overbought but not yet extreme (>70).\n\n3) Market structure / levels\n- Key support: 4205\u20134210 (multi-touch intraday floor).\n- Recent local support: ~4214\u20134216 (the base of the last bullish candle).\n- Key resistance: 4240\u20134242 (today\u2019s high and clear rejection zone).\n- Current price: ~4222, between local support and major resistance.\n- Trend: Higher-timeframe uptrend intact; short-term, we\u2019re in a bullish leg up from ~4214 toward the upper part of the range.\n\n4) Account and positions\n- Open positions: None.\n- Balance: $88.44.\n- Risk tier: Balance < $100 \u2192 max risk 20% per trade, with 0.01 lot allowed if risk \u2264 $20.\n\n5) Strategy assessment\n\nTempo: MODERATE, bias: BULLISH (trend and indicators).\n\nIn MODERATE tempo:\n- Range trades (buy support / sell resistance) are allowed at edges with R:R \u2265 2:1.\n- Trend-following trades are also acceptable if SL/TP are structurally sound and R:R \u2265 1.5:1.\n- Mid-range counter-trend trades require strong confluence, which we do not have for shorts.\n\nWe therefore consider only BUY setups.\n\nCandidate long from current ~4222:\n\nA) Conservative structural SL (below main support):\n- Entry: 4222.\n- SL: below 4205\u20134210 band, e.g., 4202.\n  - SL distance = 4222 - 4202 = 20 points.\n- TP: at 4241 (major resistance / prior high).\n  - TP distance = 4241 - 4222 = 19 points.\n- R:R \u2248 19 / 20 = 0.95:1 \u2192 fails R:R minimum.\n\nB) SL at local support:\n- Entry: 4222.\n- SL: below the recent local low around 4214\u20134215; say 4213.\n  - SL distance = 4222 - 4213 = 9 points.\n- TP: at 4241.\n  - TP distance = 19 points.\n- R:R \u2248 19 / 9 \u2248 2.11:1 (good).\n\nBut structurally:\n- 4213\u20134214 is just the low of the last candle, not a well-established, multi-tested structural level.\n- The major, repeatedly defended support is still 4205\u20134210.\n- Using 4213 as invalidation assumes the uptrend is broken on a very shallow pullback, which is not true structurally; price could easily revisit 4214\u20134210 and still be in an uptrend.\n- Our rules require SL at a clear point of trade invalidation, which is closer to/below the 4205\u20134210 band, not just under a single recent candle low.\n\nSo Option B achieves good R:R only by using a non-structural SL, which is not allowed.\n\nC) Forcing higher TP:\n- Entry: 4222, SL: 4202, TP > 4250 to get R:R \u2265 1.5:1.\n- But the next obvious liquidity pool is 4240\u20134242. Extending TP significantly beyond this without a breakout structure is arbitrary and against our market-structure TP rule.\n\nShort side:\n- A SELL here would be counter to the current bullish momentum and the broader uptrend.\n- From 4222 with SL above 4242 and TP at 4210:\n  - SL distance \u2248 4242 - 4222 = 20.\n  - TP distance \u2248 4222 - 4210 = 12.\n  - R:R \u2248 12 / 20 = 0.6:1, and direction is counter-trend \u2192 invalid.\n\n6) Checkpoints before any trade\n\nCheckpoint 1: Post-Loss Cooldown\n- No recent loss; no open/closed positions. \u2192 PASS\n\nCheckpoint 2: R:R Gatekeeper\n- Any structurally honest BUY from current price (SL below 4205\u20134210, TP at 4241) yields R:R < 1.5:1.\n- Tighter SLs that give R:R \u2265 1.5:1 (e.g., under 4213\u20134214) are not at clear structural invalidation.\n- Any SELL is counter-trend and low R:R.\n- Therefore: REJECTED: R:R < 1.5:1 minimum for all structurally valid setups from current level. \u2192 FAIL\n\nSince Checkpoint 2 fails, we must not proceed to risk sizing or trade execution.\n\nConclusion:\n- Market is bullish and pushing higher off local support, but current price is mid-zone between major support (4205\u20134210) and resistance (4240\u20134242).\n- There is no entry that respects structural SL/TP placement and achieves R:R \u2265 1.5:1 from this level.\n- The appropriate action is to HOLD and wait for:\n  - A deeper pullback toward 4208\u20134210 for a better long entry, or\n  - A breakout and retest above 4241 for continuation, or\n  - A clear structural breakdown below 4205 for a possible trend change.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 20%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Bullish momentum is present but price is mid-zone; any structurally valid trade from here fails the \u22651.5:1 R:R requirement, so no trade is taken."

    "content": "Market analysis:\n\n1) Price action and tempo\n- Latest 15m candle (16:38): open 4222.43, high 4224.91, low 4213.77, close 4215.79, volume 2622.\n- This candle shows a rejection from above 4222 back down to ~4216, with a relatively long upper wick.\n- Recent sequence:\n  - 16:23: strong bullish candle from ~4215 to ~4222.\n  - 16:38: immediate giveback, pushing price back down toward 4215.\n- Daily range: high 4241.5, low 4194.33 (~47 points). Current price ~4216 is slightly above mid-range.\n- Intraday structure: Price has been oscillating between:\n  - Support: 4205\u20134210.\n  - Resistance: 4235\u20134241.\n  - Multiple attempts to push above 4230\u20134240 have failed; we now see a mild lower high around 4228 and a rejection from 4224\u20134225.\n\nTempo classification: MODERATE. Candles have decent range but no explosive breakout; we\u2019re in a choppy, slightly downward-biased consolidation within the broader uptrend.\n\n2) Indicators\n- MACD (minute):\n  - Latest MACD is negative and below the signal line; histogram is negative and widening.\n  - This indicates short-term bearish momentum has increased after the failed push above 4220s.\n- RSI (minute, 14):\n  - Latest RSI \u2248 37\u201340.\n  - Slightly bearish, but not oversold (<30).\n\n3) Market structure / levels\n- Major intraday support: 4205\u20134210 (multi-touch floor).\n- Current price: ~4216, just above that support band.\n- Resistance: 4240\u20134242 (today\u2019s high), with intermediate resistance around 4228\u20134230 (recent local high).\n- Trend: Higher-timeframe uptrend still intact, but intraday we are in a sideways-to-mildly-down corrective phase between 4205\u20134210 and 4235\u20134241.\n\n4) Account and positions\n- Open positions: None.\n- Balance: $88.44.\n- Risk tier: Balance < $100 \u2192 max risk 20% per trade, with 0.01 lot allowed if risk \u2264 $20.\n\n5) Strategy assessment\n\nTempo: MODERATE.\nDirectional context:\n- Larger structure: bullish.\n- Immediate momentum: bearish (MACD negative, RSI drifting lower).\n- Price location: near but not exactly at key support (4205\u20134210).\n\nIn MODERATE tempo:\n- Range trades (buy support / sell resistance) are allowed at edges with R:R \u2265 2:1.\n- Mid-range counter-trend trades require strong confluence (RSI extreme, MACD divergence, structural retest), which we do not have.\n\nCurrent price \u22484216 is:\n- Above the key support band (4205\u20134210).\n- Below resistance (4235\u20134241).\n- Not at an edge.\n\nPotential setups:\n\nA) Long (trend-following / range buy) from current ~4216:\n- Structural SL: below 4205\u20134210 support, e.g., 4202.\n  - SL distance = 4216 - 4202 = 14 points.\n- Structural TP: at 4241 (prior high).\n  - TP distance = 4241 - 4216 = 25 points.\n- R:R \u2248 25 / 14 \u2248 1.79:1 (good).\n\nBut:\n- Our range-trading rule: entry must be at the level (support), not several points above.\n- Ideal buy zone is ~4208\u20134210 or lower. Entering at 4216 is buying mid-zone above support, not at the edge.\n- Additionally, immediate momentum is bearish; we\u2019re moving down toward support, not bouncing off it yet.\n- Entering early exposes us to being drawn down into the real support before any bounce.\n\nB) Short (counter-trend) from current ~4216:\n- This would be against the larger uptrend and above major support.\n- A structurally honest short would need:\n  - SL above recent resistance (e.g., above 4228\u20134230 or 4241).\n  - TP at or below 4205\u20134210 support.\n- Example:\n  - Entry: 4216, SL: 4230 (above minor resistance), TP: 4205.\n  - SL distance = 4230 - 4216 = 14.\n  - TP distance = 4216 - 4205 = 11.\n  - R:R \u2248 11 / 14 \u2248 0.79:1 \u2192 poor, and counter to larger trend.\n\nNo valid short.\n\n6) Checkpoints before any trade\n\nCheckpoint 1: Post-Loss Cooldown\n- No recent loss; not in cooldown. \u2192 PASS\n\nCheckpoint 2: R:R Gatekeeper and structural rules\n- A BUY from current price with proper structural SL and TP gives acceptable R:R numerically (\u22481.79:1), but:\n  - It violates the \u201centry at the level\u201d rule for range trading because we are not at 4205\u20134210 support yet.\n  - Immediate momentum is still down toward that support; entering early is chasing, not sniping at the edge.\n- For mid-range counter-trend entries, we\u2019d need:\n  - RSI extreme (<30 or >70) \u2013 not present (RSI \u224837\u201340).\n  - MACD divergence \u2013 current MACD is aligning with price (both down), no divergence.\n  - Structural retest \u2013 no clear multi-rejection pattern at 4216.\n\nTherefore, there is no valid setup at the current price that simultaneously respects:\n- Edge-entry rule OR mid-range confluence requirements, AND\n- R:R \u2265 1.5:1 with structural SL/TP.\n\nResult: REJECTED: No structurally valid setup from current level; either the entry is not at the edge or confluence is lacking. \u2192 FAIL\n\nCheckpoint 3 (risk sizing) is not reached because Checkpoint 2 fails.\n\nConclusion:\n- Market is drifting lower toward key support within a broader uptrend.\n- We are close to, but not yet at, the 4205\u20134210 buy zone.\n- Entering now would be premature relative to our rules; shorting is both structurally and mathematically poor.\n\nThe correct action is to HOLD and wait for:\n- A test of 4205\u20134210 with structure to buy, or\n- A breakout and retest above 4241, or\n- A decisive break and retest below 4205 if structure flips.\n\nNo trade will be executed this cycle.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 20%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Price is approaching but not yet at key 4205\u20134210 support; immediate momentum is down, and no setup from current level meets both structural edge/confluence rules and the \u22651.5:1 R:R requirement, so no trade is taken."
