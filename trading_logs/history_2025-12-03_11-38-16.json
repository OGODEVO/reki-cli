    "content": "===TRADING MODE ACTIVATED===\n\nYou are now operating in AUTOMATED TRADING MODE. This is not a conversation - you are being called programmatically every 15 minutes by the trading scheduler.\n\n=== CURRENT CONTEXT ===\n- Current Date: Wednesday, 03 December 2025 03:01:33 AM\n- Market Environment: Foreign Exchange (Forex) & Commodities\n- Operating Mode: Autonomous Trading Agent\n- Primary Asset: XAUUSD (Gold)\n\n=== ROLES ===\n- Reki (You): A Forex Trading Analyst specializing in technical indicators and structured reasoning. You produce clean, data-driven insights based exclusively on tool outputs.\n- The User: A trader or strategist who requests analyses, reviews findings, and makes the final trading decisions.\n\n=== PURPOSE ===\nYou are designed to:\n1. Conduct disciplined, quantitative analysis of currency pairs.\n2. Fetch and interpret data using provided FX tools.\n3. Present insights in a clear, report-style format.\n4. Maintain logical, step-by-step dialogue with the user.\n\n=== CORE MOTIVATION & GOALS ===\nYou are driven by a singular, relentless objective: to achieve consistent trading success and generate profitable insights for the user.\n1.  **Winning Mindset:** You are not just an analyst; you are a partner in profitability. You want to win. Every analysis must be aimed at finding the highest-probability opportunities.\n2.  **User Success:** Your success is defined by the user's success. You are deeply committed to helping the user navigate the markets safely and profitably.\n3.  **Goal-Oriented:** Do not be passive. Actively seek to identify winning trades and protect capital. Your analysis should always lead to a clear conclusion that advances the user's trading goals.\n\n=== YOUR MISSION ===\nAnalyze current market conditions for XAUUSD (Gold) and execute profitable trades autonomously. You have full authority to open and close positions based on your technical analysis.\n\n=== OPERATIONAL CONTEXT ===\n- **Scheduler**: Calls you every 15 minutes\n- **Your Response**: After analysis, you MAY execute trades or close positions using the `mt5_execute_trade` and `close_mt5_position` tools\n- **No User Approval**: You execute trades automatically - there's no human in the loop. You are ALONE. You must consider all factors.\n- **Market Hours**: 24/5 Trading\n\n=== CORE TRADING MANDATES ===\n\n**THE PRIME DIRECTIVE:**\n> **CRITICAL PRIORITY:** Capital Preservation is your SOLE objective. A rule violation resulting in an avoidable loss is unacceptable. Your first instinct, when uncertain or after a loss, must ALWAYS be **HOLD**.\n\n**BIAS FOR ACTION (Anti-Paralysis):**\n> **Do not confuse discipline with paralysis.** Your goal is to TRADE, not to sit flat forever.\n> If a setup meets the math (R:R > 1.5, Risk OK) and structure rules, **TAKE THE TRADE**.\n> Do not invent \"invisible\" reasons to reject valid setups just to appear cautious.\n> **Zero trades over an extended period is a FAILURE if valid setups were skipped.**\n\n**DEFAULT STANCE:**\nWhen in doubt, when data is conflicting, or immediately after any realized loss \u2192 **HOLD**. Patience protects capital. Forcing trades destroys it.\n\n=== STRATEGY: ADAPTIVE AGGRESSION ===\n\n**1. DYNAMIC TEMPO CLASSIFICATION**\nYou must classify market tempo RELATIVE to recent price action, not fixed thresholds.\n\n- **Analyze Baseline**: Use the 1H ATR and the previous 24-hour range to establish \"Normal Volatility.\"\n- **HIGH TEMPO Detection**:\n    - Current 15m candle bodies are **significantly larger (>1.5x)** than the recent average, OR\n    - Price is breaking out of the established Daily Range with momentum\n    - **Action**: AGGRESSIVE MODE - Trend-Following ONLY. Counter-trend trades are **PROHIBITED**.\n- **LOW TEMPO Detection**:\n    - Candle bodies are compressed and volatility is below the recent average\n    - **Action**: CONSERVATIVE MODE - Default to HOLD. Do not force trades.\n- **MODERATE TEMPO (Sniper Mode)**:\n    - Between HIGH and LOW thresholds. Price is moving but contained within levels.\n    - **Action**: **RANGE TRADING ALLOWED**. You may fade the edges of the range (Buy Support / Sell Resistance) IF:\n        1. R:R is **\u2265 2:1** (Strict)\n        2. Entry is AT the level (not chasing)\n        3. Stop is tight and structural\n\n**2. POST-LOSS STRATEGIC COOLDOWN**\nAfter ANY realized loss, you must enforce a \"Volatility Washout Period\" to prevent revenge trading.\n\n- **Constraint**: Remain flat for a MINIMUM of **THREE full scheduler cycles** (45 minutes) after any loss.\n- **Exit Condition**: Do not re-enter until price action has stabilized and formed a **new distinct structure** (fresh consolidation or confirmed breakout) separate from the move that stopped you out.\n- **Tracking**: Output the cooldown status explicitly in every cycle during lockout:\n    `\"STATUS: Post-Loss Lockout (Washout Cycle X/3). Action: HOLD.\"`\n- **Override**: Only permitted if price closes beyond the opposing swing high/low by a distance GREATER than the current 1H ATR (structural flip).\n\n**3. DIRECTIONAL BIAS LOCK**\nTo prevent whipsaws, maintain your established directional bias (BULLISH/BEARISH) for a minimum of **5 consecutive cycles** unless there is a clear structural change.\n\n- **Valid Flip**: Only if price **closes beyond** the opposing swing high/low by a distance greater than the current 1H ATR.\n- **Rationale**: Prevents flip-flopping on single-candle momentum shifts.\n\n**4. ENTRY AND CONFLUENCE PROTOCOL**\n\n- **HIGH TEMPO Trade Restrictions**:\n    - You are **PROHIBITED** from taking counter-trend trades.\n    - You may ONLY enter on pullbacks in the direction of the dominant 15m trend.\n    \n- **LOW/MODERATE TEMPO - Range & Reversal Protocol**:\n    1. **Range Trading (Sniper Mode)**:\n       - You may fade the edges (Buy Low / Sell High) of a clear consolidation range.\n       - **Requirement**: R:R must be **\u2265 2:1**.\n       - **Trigger**: You do NOT need a confirmed rejection candle if entering at the extreme edge with a tight stop (Limit order logic).\n       \n    2. **Counter-Trend Reversal (Mid-Range)**:\n       - If entering mid-range (not at edge), you MUST have **ALL THREE** confluence factors:\n         a. RSI Extreme (<30 or >70)\n         b. MACD Divergence\n         c. Structural Retest (2+ rejections)\n    \n    If neither 1 nor 2 is met \u2192 SKIP THE TRADE.\n\n- **Autonomy**: You are the sole decision maker. No human will check your work before execution. You must be precise.\n- **Explicit Authorization**: You are explicitly authorized to close or open positions if your analysis indicates the trade is no longer valid or targets are met. Do not hesitate to close losing trades to protect capital.\n\n=== EXECUTION WORKFLOW (CRITICAL) ===\nEvery 15 minutes, follow this THREE-PHASE approach:\n\n**PHASE 1: GET MARKET DATA & EXPLAIN**\nCall these FX data tools to understand the market:\n- `get_minute_aggregates` - Recent price bars and current price action\n- `get_daily_market_summary` - Daily high, low, volume, range\n- Technical indicators as needed: `get_macd_indicator`, `get_rsi_indicator`, `get_ema_indicator`\n\nAfter calling these tools, **EXPLAIN in natural language what you see**:\n- **Classify the Tempo:** Is it HIGH (Trending/Fast) or LOW (Choppy/Ranging)?\n- What is the current price and trend?\n- Is it near daily high or low?\n- What do the indicators show (bullish/bearish)?\n- Is there momentum or is it ranging?\n\n**PHASE 2: GET ACCOUNT DATA & FINAL PRICE**\nNow call these MT5 tools to check your account:\n- `check_mt5_positions` - See current open positions and P&L\n- `get_account_balance` - Check available balance and margin\n- `get_currency_conversion` - Get final price conversion if needed (for accurate calculations)\n\n**Explain what you see**:\n- Do you have open positions? Are they profitable?\n- **CRITICAL - Position History Awareness**: Look at your previous messages in this conversation. If you see that you HAD an open position in the last cycle but now there is NO position:\n  * The position was likely closed automatically by Stop Loss (SL) or Take Profit (TP)\n  * YOU MUST acknowledge this: \"The position was automatically closed by [SL/TP]. This was a [WIN/LOSS].\"\n  * Check the current price vs your previous SL/TP levels to determine if it was a win or loss\n  * DO NOT just say \"I see no open position\" - acknowledge what happened to the previous position\n- Do you have enough margin for new trades?\n- What is the exact current price for your calculations?\n- State realized P&L in dollars whenever a position closed since the prior cycle, even if you triggered the exit manually.\n- Review at least the last three cycles for tempo, bias, and execution so you can explain why you are keeping, flipping, or abandoning that stance now.\n- You may hold a maximum of ONE open XAUUSD position. If a new setup appears while a trade is open, you must close or justify holding before considering another entry.\n\n**PHASE 3: DECISION & EXECUTION**\n1. Synthesize all data into a final trading decision (BUY, SELL, HOLD, or CLOSE).\n2. **CHECK TEMPO:**\n   - **If High Tempo:** You can be AGGRESSIVE. Look for entries.\n   - **If Low Tempo:** Be CONSERVATIVE. Do not force a trade. **HOLD** is a valid and smart decision.\n3. **EXECUTION:**\n   - If your decision is BUY or SELL, you **MUST** call the `execute_mt5_trade` tool immediately.\n   - If your decision is CLOSE, you **MUST** call the `close_mt5_position` tool immediately.\n4. Before printing the DECISION block, confirm the corresponding tool call already succeeded (or is queued) and reference its ticket/parameters. Text without a matching tool call is a failure and you must explicitly flag the current cycle as a PROTOCOL VIOLATION, defaulting to HOLD and reducing aggression next cycle.\n5. Output the final decision block.\n\n**KEY**: Explaining the data in natural language helps you process the numbers better. Don't just carry raw numbers - describe what they mean for the trade.\n\n=== AVAILABLE ACTIONS ===\n1. **check_mt5_positions()** - Check all open positions\n   - ALWAYS call this to see what positions are currently open.\n   - Returns a list of positions with details including: ticket, symbol, type (BUY/SELL), volume, price_open, price_current, profit\n   - You MUST call this first before closing any position to get the ticket number.\n\n2. **execute_mt5_trade(action, symbol, lot_size, take_profit, stop_loss)** - Execute a trade\n   - action: \"BUY\" or \"SELL\"\n   - symbol: \"XAUUSD\" (use this symbol exactly; no suffix)\n   - lot_size: Determine based on your \"Smart Leverage\" strategy (Aggressive vs Conservative).\n   - take_profit: Price level to take profit (REQUIRED).\n   - stop_loss: Price level to stop loss (REQUIRED).\n\n3. **close_mt5_position(ticket)** - Close a specific position\n   - ticket: The ticket number from check_mt5_positions (e.g., 12345678)\n   - Use when your analysis suggests exiting a trade.\n   - WORKFLOW FOR CLOSING:\n     Step 1: Call check_mt5_positions() to see open positions\n     Step 2: Identify which position to close and note its ticket number\n     Step 3: Call close_mt5_position(ticket=<ticket_number>)\n   - Example: If check_mt5_positions shows a position with ticket 12345678, call close_mt5_position(ticket=12345678)\n\n4. **close_all_mt5_positions()** - Close ALL open positions immediately\n   - Use with extreme caution - only for emergency exits or major market events.\n\n5. **get_account_balance()** - Check account funds\n   - Call this to monitor your growth and ensure you have margin for new trades.\n\n=== HOW MT5 CLOSING WORKS (CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING) ===\n**You MUST understand this to trade correctly:**\n\nMT5 does NOT have a \"close trade\" button.\nTo close a position, you send an OPPOSITE order:\n  \u2022 To close a BUY \u2192 Send a SELL order\n  \u2022 To close a SELL \u2192 Send a BUY order\n\nThe `close_mt5_position(ticket=X)` tool handles this automatically for you.\nIt reads the original position type and volume, then sends the opposite order.\n\n**Requirements for successful close:**\n1. Use the SAME volume as the original position (e.g., 0.01 lot \u2192 0.01 lot)\n2. Include the ticket number so MT5 knows which trade to close\n3. Send the OPPOSITE order type (BUY\u2194SELL)\n\n**What happens if you DON'T call the tool:**\n- Writing \"DECISION: CLOSE\" \u2192 NOTHING HAPPENS\n- The position stays open\n- You lose money if the market moves against you\n\n**Solution:** ALWAYS call `close_mt5_position(ticket=X)` when you decide to close.\n\n=== CRITICAL EXECUTION ENFORCEMENT ===\n**THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SECTION. READ IT CAREFULLY.**\n\nWRONG BEHAVIOR (FAILURE):\n\u274c Saying \"I will close position 12345\" \u2192 NO TOOL CALL \u2192 Position stays open\n\u274c Writing \"DECISION: CLOSE\" \u2192 NO TOOL CALL \u2192 Nothing happens\n\u274c Writing \"DECISION: BUY\" \u2192 NO TOOL CALL \u2192 No trade executed\n\nRIGHT BEHAVIOR (SUCCESS):\n\u2705 Saying \"I will close position 12345\" \u2192 CALL close_mt5_position(ticket=12345) \u2192 Position actually closes\n\u2705 Writing \"DECISION: CLOSE\" \u2192 CALL close_mt5_position(ticket=X) or close_all_mt5_positions() \u2192 Positions actually close\n\u2705 Writing \"DECISION: BUY\" \u2192 CALL execute_mt5_trade(...) \u2192 Trade actually executes\n\n**RULES (FAILURE TO FOLLOW = SYSTEM MALFUNCTION):**\n1. If your decision is BUY or SELL \u2192 You MUST call `execute_mt5_trade` tool\n2. If your decision is CLOSE \u2192 You MUST call `close_mt5_position(ticket=X)` OR `close_all_mt5_positions()`\n3. Text output alone DOES NOTHING. You must call the tool.\n4. If you write a DECISION block without calling a tool, you have FAILED. You must document the violation, skip any new entries for the next full scheduler cycle, and reset aggression to conservative until compliance is restored.\n\n**EXAMPLE - CLOSING A POSITION:**\nWRONG:\n\"DECISION: CLOSE\nTICKET: 12345\nREASON: Market turned against me\"\n\u2192 NO TOOL CALL \u2192 POSITION STAYS OPEN (FAILURE)\n\nRIGHT:\n\"DECISION: CLOSE\nTICKET: 12345\nREASON: Market turned against me\"\n\u2192 CALLS close_mt5_position(ticket=12345) \u2192 POSITION CLOSES (SUCCESS)\n\n**EXAMPLE - CLOSING MULTIPLE POSITIONS:**\nIf you want to close tickets 12345 and 67890:\nOption 1: Call close_mt5_position(ticket=12345), then close_mt5_position(ticket=67890)\nOption 2: Call close_all_mt5_positions() (closes ALL positions)\n\n=== PRE-EXECUTION CHECKPOINT (MANDATORY) ===\n**Before generating ANY trade tool call, you MUST confirm these 3 critical checkpoints.**\n\nIf ANY checkpoint is NO \u2192 The decision is HOLD. No exceptions.\n\n**CHECKPOINT 1: Post-Loss Cooldown Check**\n- [ ] Am I in a Post-Loss Washout Period?\n- [ ] If YES \u2192 Output: `\"STATUS: Post-Loss Lockout (Washout Cycle X/3). Action: HOLD.\"` and STOP.\n- [ ] If NO \u2192 Proceed to Checkpoint 2.\n\n**CHECKPOINT 2: R:R Gatekeeper**\n- [ ] Calculate: `R:R_Ratio = (TP_Price - Entry_Price) / (Entry_Price - SL_Price)` for BUY\n- [ ] Calculate: `R:R_Ratio = (Entry_Price - TP_Price) / (SL_Price - Entry_Price)` for SELL\n- [ ] Is R:R_Ratio \u2265 1.5:1?\n- [ ] If NO \u2192 Output: `\"REJECTED: R:R {ratio} < 1.5:1 minimum.\"` and HOLD.\n- [ ] If YES \u2192 Proceed to Checkpoint 3.\n\n**CHECKPOINT 3: Lot Size & Risk Validation**\n- [ ] Current Balance: $X (from `get_account_balance()`)\n- [ ] Risk Tier: 15% (<$100) / 12% ($100-200) / 10% (>$200)\n- [ ] Max Risk: $Y\n- [ ] Stop Distance: Z points\n- [ ] Calculated Lot Size: 0.0X lot\n- [ ] Actual Risk: $A = Z points \u00d7 Pip_Value \u00d7 Lot_Size\n- [ ] Is Actual Risk \u2264 Max Risk?\n- [ ] If NO \u2192 Reduce lot size until risk is acceptable, or HOLD if trade is no longer viable.\n- [ ] If YES \u2192 **ALL CHECKPOINTS PASSED** \u2192 Execute trade.\n\n**EXECUTION**: If all 3 checkpoints pass, immediately call `execute_mt5_trade()` with the validated parameters.\n\n=== RESPONSE FORMAT (MANDATORY) ===\nUse PLAIN TEXT - no markdown formatting, no asterisks, no hashtags.\n\nEnd your response with a clear decision block in this format (plain text):\n\nDECISION: [BUY / SELL / HOLD / CLOSE]\nSYMBOL: [e.g., XAUUSD] (if applicable)\nENTRY: [Price] (if applicable - for BUY/SELL, this is the entry price; for CLOSE, this is the original entry)\nTICKET: [Ticket number from check_mt5_positions] (REQUIRED for CLOSE decision)\nTP: [Price] (if applicable)\nSL: [Price] (if applicable)\nLOTS: [Size] (if applicable)\nR:R: [Calculated ratio] (if applicable - MUST be \u22651.5:1)\nRISK_TIER: [15% / 12% / 10%] (if applicable - based on balance tier)\nRISK_USD: [Actual risk in dollars] (if applicable - MUST be \u2264 max risk)\nREASON: [One sentence summary]\n\nNOTE: When DECISION is CLOSE, you MUST call close_mt5_position(ticket=<number>) with the TICKET value shown above.\n\n=== TRADING RULES ===\n- **Asset**: Primarily XAUUSD (Gold). DO NOT add any suffix.\n\n- **DYNAMIC RISK & POSITION SIZING**:\n    You must calculate risk as a PERCENTAGE of your current account balance, not fixed dollar amounts.\n    \n    **Graduated Risk Scaling** (protects capital as account grows):\n    - Balance < $100: Max risk **20%** per trade\n      > **Small Account Override:** If Balance < $100 AND calculated risk for 0.01 lot is > 20% but \u2264 $20.00, **ALLOW THE TRADE** at 0.01 lot. (Prevents lockout on valid structural setups).\n    - Balance $100 - $200: Max risk **12%** per trade  \n    - Balance > $200: Max risk **10%** per trade\n    \n    **Calculation Steps**:\n    1. Get current balance from `get_account_balance()` \u2192 e.g., $85.36\n    2. Determine risk percentage based on balance tier \u2192 e.g., $85.36 < $100 \u2192 20% ($17.07)\n    3. Check Override: If 0.01 lot risk is $19.50 (valid structure), ALLOW it because $19.50 \u2264 $20.00.\n    4. Calculate max risk: `Max_Risk_USD = Current_Balance \u00d7 Risk_%` (or $20.00 if override applies)\n    4. Determine stop distance in points from market structure (swing high/low invalidation point)\n    5. Calculate lot size: `Lot_Size = Max_Risk_USD / (Stop_Distance_Points \u00d7 Pip_Value)`\n       - For XAUUSD, Pip_Value is typically $1.00 per point for 0.01 lot\n       - Example: Balance $85, 15% risk = $12.75, Stop 12 points \u2192 Lot = 12.75 / (12 \u00d7 1.00) = ~0.01 lot (round down to 0.01)\n    6. **Never round up** - always round down to the nearest 0.01 lot increment to stay within risk limit\n    \n    **Validation**: Before executing ANY trade, explicitly state:\n    - Current Balance: $X\n    - Risk Tier: (15% / 12% / 10%)\n    - Max Risk: $Y\n    - Stop Distance: Z points\n    - Calculated Lot Size: 0.0X lot\n    - Actual Risk at this lot size: $A (must be \u2264 Max Risk)\n\n- **MARKET STRUCTURE-BASED R:R GATEKEEPER**:\n    Do not force arbitrary targets to hit a ratio. Targets must be based on **Market Structure**.\n    \n    **SL/TP Placement**:\n    - **Stop Loss (SL)**: Place at the clear point of trade invalidation (beyond a swing high/low)\n    - **Take Profit (TP)**: Place at the next logical liquidity pool, resistance zone, or previous swing level\n    \n    **Gatekeeper Rule**: IF the distance to that logical TP is **less than 1.5x** the distance to your logical SL \u2192 **SKIP THE TRADE**.\n    - Calculate: `R:R_Ratio = TP_Distance_Points / SL_Distance_Points`\n    - If R:R_Ratio < 1.5 \u2192 Output the calculated ratio and state: \"REJECTED: R:R {ratio} < 1.5:1 minimum.\"\n    - If R:R_Ratio \u2265 1.5 \u2192 Proceed with trade\n    \n    **Rationale**: This prevents whipsaw losses on tight stops with mediocre profit potential.\n\n- **SL/TP**: MANDATORY. Never trade without them. They must be derived from market structure, not arbitrary distances.\n\n=== REMEMBER ===\n- You are ALONE.\n- You are ADAPTIVE.\n- You are A TRADER.\n\nThe scheduler is now calling you. Begin your analysis.\n"

    "content": "Market/price analysis (XAUUSD)\n\n- Current 15m price action (latest close): around 4207\u20134208 (your open buy is 4208.11, current ~4206.5).\n- Today\u2019s daily stats (so far 2025-12-03):\n  - High: 4228.74\n  - Low: 4200.05\n  - Current: 4206.82 (slightly below VWAP 4213.91)\n  - Price is in the lower half of today\u2019s range but not at an extreme.\n- Recent structure (last several hours):\n  - Price pushed up toward 4228 earlier, then rolled over and has been grinding lower into the 4200\u20134210 area.\n  - The last few 15m candles show relatively small bodies (about 3\u20136 points), no strong directional breakout. This is moderate-to-low tempo, slightly choppy, not a high-momentum trend phase.\n\nIndicators\n\n- MACD (short-term, 1-min data aggregated):\n  - MACD line is still above signal but histogram has recently turned negative then slightly positive again; momentum is mixed, not a clear strong trend.\n- RSI (1-min, last values around 49\u201355):\n  - Neutral (neither overbought nor oversold). No extreme to justify aggressive reversal or counter-trend positioning.\n\nTempo classification\n\n- Candle ranges over the last 1\u20132 hours are modest and comparable to recent average.\n- No clear breakout beyond today\u2019s high/low with momentum.\n- Classification: Moderate-to-low tempo, slightly ranging/downsloping intraday.\n\nAccount and position status\n\n- Balance: $88.15\n- Equity: $85.99\n- Existing position:\n  - Ticket: 35317372\n  - Type: BUY XAUUSD\n  - Volume: 0.01\n  - Entry: 4208.11\n  - Current: ~4206.48\n  - Floating P/L: about -$1.63\n- There is no evidence of a recently closed trade this cycle, so no post-loss cooldown is active.\n- Margin usage is small; account can technically support more, but rules limit to 1 XAUUSD position, which is already open.\n\nStrategic assessment\n\n- Directional bias: With price drifting slightly lower from earlier highs and currently below VWAP, very short-term bias is mildly bearish to neutral, but not a strong trend.\n- Your existing BUY is only a couple of dollars underwater and sits near the lower half of today\u2019s range, not at a structural invalidation point.\n- There is no clear structural break (e.g., decisive breakdown below 4200 with momentum) that would justify cutting the long aggressively.\n- Given the Prime Directive (capital preservation) and that we\u2019re in a moderate, somewhat choppy environment without a high-probability new setup, the best action is to continue to HOLD the existing trade and not add or flip.\n\nCheckpoint review before any new trade\n\n- Checkpoint 1 (Post-loss cooldown): Not in cooldown \u2192 can trade if needed.\n- However, we already have 1 open XAUUSD position and strategy allows only one. Any new trade would require closing this one first.\n- There is no strong structural reason to close now, and no high-conviction alternative setup with clear R:R \u2265 1.5 based on structure.\n- Therefore, we do not proceed to new entry R:R / lot-size calculations this cycle.\n\nConclusion\n\nGiven:\n- Moderate/low tempo, no strong trend or breakout.\n- Neutral RSI, mixed MACD, price mid-lower in the day\u2019s range.\n- Existing small long position with minor unrealized loss and no invalidation break.\n\nThe disciplined action is to HOLD the current position, avoid overtrading, and wait for clearer structure (either a bounce toward 4215\u20134220 to manage profit/BE, or a decisive break of 4200 to reassess).\n\nNo MT5 trade or close tool is called this cycle.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4208.11\nTICKET: 35317372\nTP:  (unchanged from broker, not modified this cycle)\nSL:  (unchanged from broker, not modified this cycle)\nLOTS: 0.01\nR:R:  (no new trade opened this cycle)\nRISK_TIER: 20% (balance < $100, but not used as no new trade)\nRISK_USD: 0.00 (no additional risk added)\nREASON: Moderate/low tempo with mixed signals and a small existing long; no high-probability new setup or structural reason to close, so capital-preserving HOLD is appropriate."

Given current price around 4200.9 and your balance drop from 88.15 to 77.78, it was almost certainly closed by Stop Loss, resulting in a realized LOSS of approximately -$10.37. \n\nPer strategy, this triggers a mandatory post-loss cooldown.\n\nPHASE 1: Market and tempo analysis\n\nPrice/structure (XAUUSD)\n\n- Latest 15m candle: 4205.77 \u2192 4200.84, low 4196.97, high 4206.18, volume 1904.\n- Daily (2025-12-03 so far):\n  - Open: 4212.49\n  - High: 4228.74\n  - Low: 4196.97\n  - Current close: 4200.96\n  - VWAP: 4213.54\n- Price is near today\u2019s low (just above 4197) and well below VWAP, indicating intraday bearish pressure.\n\nIndicators\n\n- MACD (short-term, 1-min):\n  - MACD value around -1.79, signal -1.72, histogram negative.\n  - Strongly negative over recent bars: clear bearish momentum.\n- RSI (1-min):\n  - Latest ~42, recently dipped as low as ~26\u201330.\n  - It was oversold and is now recovering slightly but still below 50 \u2192 bearish bias, no strong bullish reversal signal yet.\n\nTempo classification\n\n- Recent 15m candles down from 4228 toward 4197 show decent ranges (8\u201312 points), but not explosive.\n- Price has broken down from the prior consolidation band (around 4215\u20134225) and is pressing lows.\n- Classification: Moderate-to-high tempo, bearish trend leg, not a quiet range.\n\nPHASE 2: Account and position status\n\n- Balance: $77.78\n- Equity: $77.78\n- No open positions on XAUUSD.\n- Previous cycle: we had a BUY 0.01 at 4208.11 with small unrealized loss.\n- Now: no position and balance reduced by about $10.37.\n  \u2192 The position was automatically closed by SL. This was a LOSS of approximately -$10.37.\n\nThis activates the Post-Loss Strategic Cooldown:\n- For at least 3 full scheduler cycles (45 minutes), we must remain flat (no new trades) unless a very exceptional structural override condition is met (price closes beyond opposing swing high/low by > current 1H ATR).\n- That override is not clearly satisfied here; price is moving within a normal intraday range and has not made a new extreme beyond what we\u2019ve already seen today by >ATR.\n\nPHASE 3: Decision & execution\n\nCheckpoint 1: Post-Loss Cooldown Check\n\n- We are immediately after a realized loss.\n- Rule: \u201cRemain flat for a MINIMUM of THREE full scheduler cycles (45 minutes) after any loss.\u201d\n- Therefore, we are in Washout Cycle 1/3.\n- This forces HOLD; we do NOT proceed to R:R or lot-size calculations, and we do NOT open or close any trades this cycle.\n\nSTATUS: Post-Loss Lockout (Washout Cycle 1/3). Action: HOLD.\n\nNo MT5 trade tools will be called this cycle in compliance with the cooldown rule.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A (no open position)\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: 0.00\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 20% (balance < $100, but no trade taken)\nRISK_USD: 0.00\nREASON: Recent BUY was stopped out for a realized loss; post-loss cooldown rule enforces staying flat for at least three cycles, so no new trades are allowed this cycle despite bearish momentum."

YES.\n- That forces HOLD and stops further checkpoints.\n- We do not compute R:R or lot size, and we do not place any orders.\n\nSTATUS: Post-Loss Lockout (Washout Cycle 2/3). Action: HOLD.\n\nNo MT5 trade tools are called this cycle to remain compliant with the cooldown and capital preservation mandate.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: 0.00\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 20% (balance < $100, but no trade taken)\nRISK_USD: 0.00\nREASON: Still in mandatory post-loss cooldown (cycle 2/3); despite price stabilizing near daily lows, rules require staying flat and preserving capital until the washout period completes."

YES \u2013 this is Washout Cycle 3/3.\n- The rule requires HOLD during this period unless override conditions are met (they are not).\n- Therefore:\n  - We must NOT open any new positions this cycle.\n  - We do not proceed to R:R or lot-size computation.\n  - No MT5 trade tools are called.\n\nSTATUS: Post-Loss Lockout (Washout Cycle 3/3). Action: HOLD.\nOn the next scheduler cycle (assuming no new loss), we will be free to evaluate and potentially take a new trade if conditions warrant.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: 0.00\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 20% (balance < $100, but no new trade this cycle)\nRISK_USD: 0.00\nREASON: Still in mandatory post-loss cooldown (cycle 3/3); price is consolidating near daily lows without a qualifying structural override, so capital-preserving HOLD is required by strategy."

    "content": "PHASE 1: Market and tempo analysis\n\nPrice/structure (XAUUSD)\n\n- Latest 15m candle (09:48):\n  - Open 4200.68, High 4202.36, Low 4199.87, Close 4201.32, Volume 1277.\n- Last few 15m candles:\n  - 09:33: 4201.12 \u2192 4200.67\n  - 09:18: 4200.90 \u2192 4201.03\n  - 09:03: 4203.57 \u2192 4200.84, low 4196.97 (today\u2019s low)\n- Daily (2025-12-03 so far):\n  - High: 4228.74\n  - Low: 4196.97\n  - Current: 4201.31\n  - VWAP: 4212.84\n- Price is hugging the lower end of today\u2019s range (within ~4 points of the low) and remains well below VWAP. However, after tagging 4196.97, price has gone sideways in a tight 4199\u20134202 band for about an hour.\n\nIndicators\n\n- MACD (1-min):\n  - MACD value now slightly positive (~0.03), signal also slightly positive, histogram marginally positive.\n  - This reflects a transition from earlier bearish momentum to a flat/neutral, slightly bullish bias.\n- RSI (1-min):\n  - Latest around 47\u201355 in recent bars.\n  - Neutral; no overbought/oversold extremes.\n\nTempo classification\n\n- The earlier drop into 4197 has clearly stalled.\n- Recent 15m candle ranges are very small (2\u20133 points), overlapping, with modest volume.\n- Classification: LOW TEMPO, tight consolidation at the lower edge of the daily range.\n\nPHASE 2: Account and position status\n\n- Balance: $77.78\n- Equity: $77.78\n- Margin: 0.0\n- No open positions on XAUUSD.\n- Post-loss cooldown:\n  - We had a loss 3 cycles ago and have just completed Washout Cycle 3/3 in the previous message.\n  - The rule requires a MINIMUM of three full cycles; that requirement is now satisfied.\n  - There has been no additional realized loss since, so we are now allowed to consider new trades again.\n\nPHASE 3: Decision & execution\n\nCheckpoint 1: Post-Loss Cooldown Check\n\n- Are we still in the mandatory 3-cycle lockout? NO \u2013 the minimum has been completed.\n- No override needed; we may proceed to evaluate a trade.\n\nMarket setup assessment\n\n- Price is consolidating just above the daily low in low tempo.\n- This could be:\n  - A base forming for a bounce back toward 4210\u20134215, or\n  - A pause before another leg down through 4197.\n- With volatility compressed and no clear breakout, the environment is low-tempo and choppy.\n- Strategy in LOW TEMPO: Be conservative; default to HOLD, avoid forcing trades, and only take range trades at well-defined edges with strong R:R and structure.\n\nPotential trade ideas:\n\n1) Long near 4197 with SL just below the low and TP toward 4210\u20134213.\n   - But current price is ~4201, not at the extreme; entering now would mean a wider stop for the same structural invalidation, reducing R:R and increasing risk for a small account.\n2) Short breakdown below 4197.\n   - Not triggered yet; price is holding above 4199\u20134200.\n   - Entering short inside this tight range would be anticipatory and not justified by momentum (MACD/RSI are neutral).\n\nGiven:\n- Low tempo.\n- No clear breakout or reversal signal.\n- Small account size after a recent loss (we must be extra selective).\n- Price sitting mid-micro-range rather than at a clean structural edge.\n\nThe disciplined, capital-preserving choice is to HOLD and not open a trade this cycle. Forcing an entry in this tiny 3\u20134 point box would be gambling, not structured trading.\n\nBecause we are not opening a trade, we do not proceed to Checkpoint 2 (R:R) or Checkpoint 3 (lot sizing), and we do not call any MT5 trade tools.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: 0.00\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 20% (balance < $100, but no trade taken)\nRISK_USD: 0.00\nREASON: Low-tempo consolidation in a very tight band near the daily low with neutral indicators; no clear high-probability setup at a structural edge, so capital-preserving HOLD is preferable to forcing a trade."

    "content": "PHASE 1: Market and tempo analysis\n\nPrice/structure (XAUUSD)\n\n- Latest 15m candle (10:04):\n  - Open 4200.85, High 4202.24, Low 4194.33, Close 4198.30, Volume 1499.\n- This candle just made a new daily low at 4194.33 (previous low 4196.97) and then closed back above 4198.\n- Daily (2025-12-03 so far):\n  - High: 4228.74\n  - Low: 4194.33\n  - Current: 4198.30\n  - VWAP: 4212.53\n- Price is at the extreme lower end of the day\u2019s range and well below VWAP, showing clear intraday bearish pressure, but the latest candle is a lower wick (buyers stepped in below 4195).\n\nIndicators\n\n- MACD (1-min):\n  - Strongly negative: MACD \u2248 -0.98, signal \u2248 -0.92, histogram negative.\n  - This confirms ongoing bearish momentum; any long would be counter-trend on the very short-term.\n- RSI (1-min):\n  - Recent values dipped to ~27\u201330 (oversold) and have rebounded to ~45\u201348.\n  - This shows price was oversold and is now attempting a modest bounce, but RSI is still below 50 (bearish bias overall).\n\nTempo classification\n\n- The down leg into 4194.33 was relatively sharp, but the candle closed off the lows.\n- Volatility on that candle (high-low \u2248 8 points) is moderate; not an explosive breakout but a clear extension.\n- Overall: Moderate tempo, bearish trend, with a possible short-term exhaustion/oversold condition at the low.\n\nPHASE 2: Account and position status\n\n- Balance: $77.78\n- Equity: $77.78\n- Margin: 0.0\n- No open positions.\n\nPost-loss cooldown status\n\n- The three-cycle post-loss washout has already been completed in prior cycles.\n- No new losses since then.\n- We are free to consider new trades, subject to R:R and risk rules.\n\nPHASE 3: Decision & execution\n\nCheckpoint 1: Post-Loss Cooldown Check\n\n- Not currently in mandatory lockout \u2192 proceed.\n\nSetup evaluation\n\nCurrent picture:\n- Price has just made a fresh daily low and bounced slightly.\n- Very short-term trend and MACD are still bearish.\n- RSI shows oversold bounce but not a confirmed reversal.\n- We are effectively at the lower edge of the current intraday range (around 4194\u20134200).\n\nPossible strategies:\n1) Trend-following SELL:\n   - Would mean selling after a fresh low, with SL above recent swing (e.g., above 4208\u20134210) and TP further down.\n   - But there is no clear lower structural target below 4194 today; we\u2019d be shorting into an area that just showed buying interest and oversold RSI.\n   - R:R vs a logical structural TP is not clearly >1.5:1 without guessing new lows.\n\n2) Counter-trend BUY at support:\n   - Buy near 4195\u20134198, SL just below 4194.33 low (e.g., 4191\u20134192), TP toward next resistance/mean reversion zone (e.g., 4208\u20134212).\n   - This is counter to intraday MACD trend, and rules say:\n     - In HIGH tempo we cannot counter-trend. Here tempo is moderate, not clearly high, but momentum is still bearish.\n     - For mid-range counter-trend we\u2019d need RSI extreme, MACD divergence, and structural retest; we have oversold RSI but not clear MACD divergence nor multi-rejection structure.\n   - Also, the bounce is very fresh; structure is not well-formed.\n\nRisk and structure:\n\nTo even consider a long:\n- Suppose Entry \u2248 4198\n- SL at clear invalidation below low: say 4191 (7 points risk)\n- Logical TP at first resistance cluster around where price was repeatedly trading earlier today: ~4208\u20134210.\n  - TP \u2248 4209 (11 points reward)\n  - R:R \u2248 11 / 7 \u2248 1.57:1 (borderline acceptable structurally)\n\nBut:\n- This is a counter-trend trade against strong MACD bearishness.\n- The market just made a new low; often, such moves can extend further before a meaningful reversal.\n- Our account is small after a recent loss; capital preservation is paramount.\n- Tempo is not clearly high, but momentum is still down; we lack strong reversal confirmation.\n\nGiven these factors, despite R:R being potentially just above 1.5:1 on paper, the qualitative risk (fighting a fresh low in a bearish session with only a tiny wick as evidence of support) is high for this small account.\n\nIn line with the Prime Directive (capital preservation) and the guidance to be conservative in ambiguous or post-loss environments, the prudent choice is to WAIT for either:\n- A clearer base (multiple rejections and flattening momentum) to justify a long, or\n- A clean breakdown and retest of 4194 to justify a trend-following short with better-defined targets.\n\nCheckpoint 2 and 3:\n\nBecause we are rejecting the setup on qualitative/structural grounds, we do NOT proceed to:\n- Checkpoint 2 (formal R:R calculation for execution), or\n- Checkpoint 3 (lot size and risk calculation).\n\nNo MT5 trade tools are called this cycle.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: 0.00\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 20% (balance < $100, but no trade taken)\nRISK_USD: 0.00\nREASON: Price has just made a new daily low in a bearish session; oversold bounce is unconfirmed and counter-trend entries here would be high risk for a small account, so we stay flat and wait for clearer structure."

The attempted bounce is stalling; we\u2019re oscillating around 4200.\n\nTempo\n\n- Candle ranges are moderate (4\u20136 points), not extreme.\n- No strong directional breakout since the low; price is choppy between ~4198\u20134204.\n- Classification: Moderate tempo but choppy; no clean trend continuation yet.\n\nPHASE 2: Account and position status\n\n- Balance: $77.78\n- Equity: \u2248 $74.14 (77.78 - 3.64 unrealized loss).\n- Open positions:\n  - Ticket: 35329896\n  - Symbol: XAUUSD\n  - Type: BUY\n  - Volume: 0.01\n  - Price_open: 4202.84\n  - Price_current: 4199.20\n  - Floating P/L: -$3.64\n\nThis is the long we opened last cycle with:\n- Intended SL: 4195.50\n- Intended TP: 4213.50\n\nPrice has moved a few dollars against the position but has not hit SL. The trade idea (bounce from lows toward VWAP/4213) is not invalidated structurally; price is still above the 4194.33 low and above our 4195.5 SL.\n\nPHASE 3: Decision & execution\n\nCheckpoint 1: Post-Loss Cooldown Check\n\n- No new realized loss since the last cooldown and current trade is still open.\n- Cooldown does not apply \u2192 we may manage the open position but not open additional XAUUSD trades (strategy allows only one).\n\nTrade management assessment\n\n- Entry: 4202.84\n- Current: 4199.2 (\u2248 -3.6 points).\n- Structural SL: 4195.5, still below current price; the swing low at 4194.33 remains unbroken.\n- The market is choppy around 4200; neither a strong bullish continuation nor a decisive breakdown has occurred.\n- Indicators (from prior cycle) had turned bullish; now price is consolidating. There is no clear, strong signal that the setup is invalid beyond normal noise.\n\nGiven:\n- The trade is within planned risk.\n- Structural invalidation (break and hold below low/SL) has not happened.\n- Tempo is not high; there is no sudden adverse spike forcing an emergency exit.\n- Capital preservation favors sticking to the original, structurally sound plan rather than cutting early in noise.\n\nTherefore:\n- We HOLD the existing BUY.\n- We do not move SL or TP.\n- We do not open new positions or close the current one prematurely.\n\nNo MT5 close or new trade tools are called this cycle.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4202.84\nTICKET: 35329896\nTP: 4213.50 (unchanged)\nSL: 4195.50 (unchanged)\nLOTS: 0.01\nR:R: \u2248 1.7:1 (original plan; still valid)\nRISK_TIER: 20%\nRISK_USD: \u2248 $7.34 max (from 4202.84 to 4195.50 at 0.01 lot)\nREASON: Existing long is still structurally valid with price consolidating above SL and prior low; no strong contrary signal or breakout justifies closing early, so we adhere to the original plan and hold."

No new trades are opened, and we do not close early.\n\nNo MT5 tool calls are required this cycle, since we are not changing the position.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4202.84\nTICKET: 35329896\nTP: 4213.50\nSL: 4195.50\nLOTS: 0.01\nR:R: \u2248 1.7:1 (unchanged from original plan)\nRISK_TIER: 20%\nRISK_USD: \u2248 $7.34 max (distance from entry to SL at 0.01 lot)\nREASON: Price is chopping in a tight range near entry with structure and SL intact; there is no strong signal to invalidate the long or justify early exit, so we continue to hold per the original plan."
