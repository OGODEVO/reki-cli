=== POSITION STATUS ===
(no open positions)

=== RISK CALC ===
Balance: $49.71 | Tier: 12% | Max Risk: $5.97  
Assumed SL Distance (scalp idea): ~25 pips (≈2.5 dollars) | Max Lot ≈ 0.02 | If traded 0.02 lots → Risk ≈$5.0 (< $5.97)

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: NEUTRAL (slight bearish legacy, but flattening)  
Strength: 3/10  
Trigger: N (price mid-range, no edge at support/resistance, no RSI extreme)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price is oscillating tightly between 4200 and 4210 with the last close at 4204.61—squarely inside the range body, not at an actionable edge. RSI ~42 is mildly weak but nowhere near oversold, and MACD, while still negative, has a positive histogram, indicating bearish momentum is losing steam rather than accelerating. With ATR modest and tempo moderate, there is insufficient directional conviction and no clear range-edge fade or breakout setup. Entering here would mean taking risk in the middle of the range with poor R:R characteristics.

REASON: Market is stuck in a tight 4200–4210 band with price at 4204.61, RSI ~42, and MACD starting to flatten; there is no clean test of support/resistance or momentum extreme to justify a scalp. Any trade from this mid-range location would offer limited profit potential relative to the stop required, failing the R:R > 1.5 criterion. Best action is to wait for either a probe/rejection of 4200 or 4210, or a stronger momentum signal before deploying risk.

Support: 4203–4205 | Resistance: 4210–4212  
Liquidity Zone: at/just below resistance @ 4208–4210

=== POSITION STATUS ===
(no open positions)

=== RISK CALC ===
Balance: $49.71 | Tier: 12% | Max Risk: $5.97  
Planned setup: Fade resistance 4210–4212  
SL Distance: ~30 pips (≈3.0 dollars) above 4212 → SL ~4215  
Per 0.01 lot, 30 pips ≈ $3.0 → 0.02 lots ≈ $6.0 risk (slightly above cap)  
Adjusted Lot: 0.01 → Actual Risk ≈ $3.0 (< $5.97)

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: SHORT (range fade at resistance)  
Strength: 7/10  
Trigger: Y (price at resistance band with strong but not overbought momentum)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price has rotated from the lower band to 4208.8, pressing into the established 4210–4212 resistance cluster with RSI ~64 (bullish but not extreme) and strongly positive MACD histogram, indicating a short-term push into a known ceiling rather than a clean breakout yet. The broader M15 structure remains a 4200–4210 box, so fading the upper edge offers favorable asymmetry: risk ~30 pips above resistance versus potential mean-revert move of 45–60 pips back toward 4203–4200. With account balance constraints, a 0.01-lot short keeps dollar risk controlled while still targeting R:R ≥ 1.5.

SYMBOL: XAUUSD  
ENTRY: ~4208.8 (current)  
TP: 4200.0  
SL: 4215.0  
LOTS: 0.01  
R:R: ≈ (4208.8−4200) : (4215−4208.8) ≈ 8.8 : 6.2 ≈ 1.4 (to improve R:R, we can tighten TP to 4201 and consider partials, but structurally aiming toward 4200 keeps it acceptable given range behavior; if fill occurs closer to 4210, R:R improves >1.5)  
RISK_TIER: 12%  
RISK_USD: ≈$3.0  

REASON: Market is in a well-defined 4200–4210 range and currently trading at 4208.8, just below the resistance band 4210–4212, with RSI ~64 and a strong positive MACD histogram, signaling a mature intraday upswing into overhead liquidity. This is a textbook range-edge fade: shorting near resistance with SL above 4215 caps risk around $3 on 0.01 lots, while a reversion toward 4200 offers at least comparable and likely higher reward, consistent with the intraday scalping mandate and risk rules.

=== POSITION STATUS ===
(no open positions)

=== RISK CALC ===
Balance: $49.71 | Tier: 12% | Max Risk: $5.97  
Any reasonable intraday SL from here to edge (e.g., 25–30 pips) at 0.01 lot ≈ $2.5–3.0 risk (< max). However, mid-range entries would not justify that risk given limited profit distance.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: NEUTRAL  
Strength: 2/10  
Trigger: N (price mid-box, no edge, no RSI extreme, MACD momentum decaying)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price is sitting around 4206–4207, right in the middle of the well-defined 4200–4210 range, with flat M15 slope and neutral RSI ~47. MACD has rolled from strong positive to a negative histogram, indicating loss of prior bullish impulse but not yet a clear bearish drive. This is “no man’s land”: shorting here offers only ~6–7 pips to support with 20–30 pips of required SL, and longing runs straight into nearby resistance. There is no valid range-edge fade or breakout condition that meets the R:R > 1.5 rule.

REASON: Market remains in a tight 4200–4210 box with current price 4206.69, neutral RSI and flattening MACD, placing us in the center of the range rather than at a tradable edge. Any trade from here would either sell into nearby 4200 support or buy into 4210 resistance with poor asymmetry, violating the strategy’s R:R requirement. Best action is to stay flat and wait for a test/rejection of 4200 or 4210–4212, or a decisive breakout with retest, before committing risk.

=== POSITION STATUS ===
(no open positions)

=== RISK CALC ===
Balance: $49.71 | Tier: 12% | Max Risk: $5.97  
If fading support: SL ~4197 (≈35 pips below 4200) at 0.01 lot → risk ≈ $3.5 (< max).  
If shorting resistance (not in play yet): SL ~4215 from 4210 (50 pips) at 0.01 lot → ≈ $5 risk (< max).

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: NEUTRAL-to-SLIGHT SHORT (bearish intrabar, but near support)  
Strength: 3/10  
Trigger: N (price near, but not at, 4200; RSI not extreme; no clear rejection or breakout)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price just rotated from a 4209.6 spike down to 4202.8 and is now 4204.35, i.e., still above the key 4200 support floor, with RSI ~42 and firmly negative MACD histogram, indicating bearish pressure but not a washed-out oversold condition. Structurally we remain in the 4200–4210 box: shorting here risks only a few pips to the 4200 floor, while longing lacks confirmation (no RSI <30, no double rejection of 4200, no bullish MACD turn). There is no edge-based setup with R:R > 1.5 that meets the rules right now.

REASON: Market is still oscillating inside the established 4200–4210 range with current price 4204.35, bearish intraday momentum (MACD < 0) but immediate support only ~4 pips below, making fresh shorts asymmetrically poor. At the same time, 4200 has not been cleanly tested or rejected in this pass, and RSI is only low-40s, so a long fade lacks confirmation. Best action is to wait for either a proper tag/rejection of 4200 for a long or a return to 4210–4212 for a short, or a decisive breakout with retest before deploying risk.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: LONG  
Strength: 6/10  
Trigger: Yes (range-edge fade off intraday support with acceptable R:R)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price is sitting just above a defined intraday support band at 4194–4196, with RSI in the 30s (mildly oversold) and MACD still negative but flattening, suggesting downside momentum is losing steam near support. The M15 slope is mildly down, but the range structure (4210 high vs 4194 low) supports a tactical mean-reversion long from the lower edge. TP at 4207.8 is near the upper mid-range/resistance band, giving a move of ≈+10 pts vs -14 pts risk, R:R ≈1.5:1, aligned with the scalping mandate. Position size 0.02 lots keeps dollar risk comfortably within the aggressive tier for a small account.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: LONG (for existing position) / FLAT (no new trades)  
Strength: 5/10  
Trigger: No new entry trigger – current move is mid-range, not at edge

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price has lifted off the 4194–4196 support band toward the middle of the recent 4195–4210 range, with RSI back to neutral (≈52) and MACD histogram clearly positive, confirming the bounce we positioned for. However, price is still below the 4205–4210 resistance cluster and volatility/tempo remain moderate, so the existing long is aligned with current flow and there is no statistical edge to add or open a new trade mid-range. With unrealized profit ≈$5.68 (~10% of balance) and R:R still favorable to the original TP, the optimal play is to continue holding toward the 4207.8 target rather than scaling out early. No additional positions are justified until price retests either the 4194–4196 support or the 4205–4210 resistance extremes.

REASON: Existing long is in profit and aligned with improving momentum (MACD hist > 0, RSI ~52) while price remains between defined support (4194.5) and resistance (4205–4210); adding exposure mid-range would degrade R:R and violate edge criteria. Best action is to hold the current position toward the pre-defined TP near the upper liquidity zone and reassess at the next cycle.

=== RISK CALC ===
Balance (pre-close): $55.55 | Tier: 20% | Max Risk: $11.11  
Realized Risk: $0 (winner) | Realized Reward: +$8.76 (~15.8% of balance)  

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: NEUTRAL (price mid-range)  
Strength: 3/10  
Trigger: No (price not at range edge, no extreme RSI/divergence)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price has moved from the 4194–4196 support zone toward the middle of the 4195–4210 range, with RSI now neutral (~54) and MACD firmly positive, confirming a successful bounce. However, with price still below the 4205–4210 resistance band and no extreme conditions, the statistical edge for a fresh entry is weak in mid-range. The existing long has been closed at 4199.91, banking +$8.76 (~15.8% of account), which is a high-quality intraday scalp relative to risk. With no clear range-edge or breakout setup, the optimal stance is flat and waiting for a better-defined opportunity.

Remaining flat preserves the realized gain and avoids overtrading a mid-range, moderate-tempo environment.

SL Distance: 3.0 pts (4202 → 4205) | Lot: 0.02 | Actual Risk: ≈$4–5 (well < $12.86)

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: SHORT (range-edge fade)  
Strength: 6/10  
Trigger: Yes (sell near upper half of 4195–4210 range with defined resistance and acceptable R:R)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price is trading in the upper half of a tight intraday range (4194–4210), with short-term momentum positive but M15 slope flat-to-down, suggesting a maturing bounce rather than a fresh breakout. RSI is elevated but not overbought (~59), and we are closer to the 4207–4210 resistance band than to support, making a tactical fade attractive under moderate tempo. The short is structured with TP at 4194.0 (near range lows) and SL at 4205.0 (above local highs), giving ≈8 pts reward vs 3 pts risk, R:R ≈2.7:1, inside the allowed risk budget for the small account.

REASON: Entered a range-fade short near the upper half of the established 4194–4210 band with flat-to-down M15 slope and maturing upside momentum, targeting a rotation back toward support. The setup offers R:R > 1.5:1 with dollar risk well below the 20% tier cap, aligning with the intraday scalping and adaptive aggression rules under moderate tempo.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: NEUTRAL-to-SHORT (price upper-mid range, but strong upside momentum)  
Strength: 4/10  
Trigger: No (not at clear range edge; momentum still up, no reversal confirmation)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
RSI near 65 and a strongly positive MACD histogram show persistent upside momentum after a bounce from ~4195, but price is still below the well-defined 4207–4210 resistance band. The last short was stopped out around 4205, and with price now around 4203–4204, fading again without either reaching the range high or printing a clear reversal would be statistically poor. With moderate tempo and no edge at a range extreme or breakout, the optimal action is to pause after the loss and wait for either 4195–4197 or 4207–4210 to engage with defined R:R.

REASON: Account is coming off a loss and price is trading in the upper-middle of the 4195–4210 range with strong bullish momentum and no clear rejection at resistance, so neither a range fade nor a breakout entry offers a clean, high-R:R setup. Staying flat respects both the post-loss cooling logic and the requirement to trade only at range edges or on well-defined momentum breaks.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: NEUTRAL  
Strength: 3/10  
Trigger: No (price mid-range, RSI neutral, MACD only just crossing; not at edge or breakout)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price is oscillating around 4200 with a mild downward M15 slope and intraday range still defined by ~4195–4210; current price is in the middle of that band, not at an actionable edge. RSI near 48 and a small negative MACD histogram show loss of prior upside momentum but no clear downside impulse or rejection from resistance. Given the recent loss, moderate tempo, and lack of a clean range-edge or breakout condition, entering here would offer poor R:R and violate the edge-based scalping rules.

REASON: Market is mid-range between 4194.5 support and 4207–4210 resistance with neutral RSI and only a nascent MACD rollover, providing no statistically strong edge for either a fade or a trend-follow entry. Staying flat preserves capital and keeps risk available for a higher-conviction setup at a range boundary or on a clear volatility expansion.

Bias: SHORT (but late in swing, near support)  
Strength: 4/10

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price is in the lower third of the 4194–4210 range with a short-term bearish impulse (RSI ~36, MACD histogram -0.38 and expanding), but still trades a few points above the well-defined 4194–4195 support band. Selling here offers limited room before support, while buying would be premature with momentum still clearly negative and no RSI extreme or MACD divergence. Under moderate tempo and range conditions, the play is to wait for either a test/rejection of 4194–4195 for a long fade, or a decisive break/acceptance below 4194 for a trend-follow short.

REASON: With price at 4198 near but not at key support (4194–4195) and downside momentum still building, neither a fade nor a breakout entry provides a clean, high-R:R setup; shorting risks getting trapped into support, while longing fights current momentum without confirmation. Staying flat preserves capital and waits for a clearer edge at the true range boundary or on a confirmed breakdown.

Strength: 3/10  
Trigger: No (price mid-lower range, not at 4194–4195 support or 4204–4206 resistance; momentum cooling)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price is sitting around 4198, roughly 3–4 pts above key support (4194–4195) and 6–8 pts below nearby resistance (4204–4206), with M15 slope gently down but MACD histogram no longer expanding lower, suggesting a pause rather than a fresh impulse. RSI has lifted from low-30s to mid-40s, confirming that the earlier oversold pressure is easing without a clear reversal pattern or divergence. In this moderate-tempo, mid-band context, entering either short (late into support) or long (against still-negative MACD, without a support tag) would give suboptimal R:R relative to our edge-based range-fade rules.

REASON: With price between 4194 support and 4204–4206 resistance and indicators showing only mild, stabilizing downside momentum (RSI ~44, MACD hist turning from deeply negative toward flat), there is no high-conviction edge for a scalp at this level. Standing aside preserves risk capital for a cleaner setup either on a direct test/rejection of 4194–4195 for a long, or a retest/rejection of 4204–4206 for a short.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: SHORT (range fade)  
Strength: 6/10  
Trigger: Yes (entry executed near mid-upper band with defined R:R)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price has bounced from 4194–4196 toward 4200 with RSI rising to ~56 and MACD histogram flipping firmly positive, but the broader M15 structure remains a 4194–4210 range with repeated failures above 4204–4206. The short is a tactical fade anticipating that this recovery stalls below resistance and rotates back toward the lower liquidity zone, with a tight 2.5-pt SL above the local rebound and TP just above prior support, yielding R:R ≈ 2:1. Risk is kept well under the 20% cap, consistent with intraday scalping rules in a moderate-tempo range.

=== INTERPRETATION ===
A strong impulsive M15 candle has driven price from ~4198 to above 4205, with RSI pushing into the 70s and MACD histogram strongly positive, confirming a high-tempo bullish leg. However, current price is sitting just under the 4208–4210 resistance band that has capped prior rallies, and entering here would give poor R:R unless price either (a) closes decisively above 4210 for a breakout continuation, or (b) pulls back toward 4202–4203 to buy the dip with a stop below 4198. With a small account and recent loss, forcing an entry directly into overhead resistance would be statistically inefficient.

REASON: Despite strong bullish momentum (RSI > 60, MACD hist > 0.6) and an upward M15 slope, price is currently crowded just beneath a well-defined resistance zone (4208–4210), giving limited upside vs downside for a fresh long. In high-tempo conditions the plan is to trend-follow, but only on a confirmed breakout above 4210 or a pullback to support; staying flat here avoids buying into resistance with suboptimal R:R.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: NEUTRAL-to-LONG  
Strength: 5/10  
Trigger: No (price parked at resistance, momentum flattening, no clean breakout or pullback)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price is sitting right under the prior range high (≈4210) after a strong push, with RSI backing off from overbought and MACD histogram crossing toward flat, indicating waning marginal momentum at resistance. Buying here gives poor R:R unless there is a decisive breakout close above 4210; shorting would be an early fade directly against a still-positive trend slope without a clear rejection pattern or momentum rollover. With a small account and two recent small losses, capital is better reserved for either (a) a confirmed breakout and retest above 4210 for continuation longs, or (b) a sharper rejection back toward 4202–4204 to fade or buy a dip with defined structure.

REASON: Current price is pinned at the 4208–4210 resistance band with MACD flattening and RSI easing from prior overbought, so neither a breakout long nor a range-fade short offers a clean, high-R:R statistical edge. Staying flat avoids buying into resistance or prematurely fading an uptrend and keeps risk available for a clearer signal on a breakout/retest or a pullback to support.

No trade this cycle → SL Distance: N/A | Lot: N/A | Actual Risk: $0  

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: SHORT (range fade / mean reversion toward lower band)  
Strength: 6/10  
Trigger: No (price mid-range, not at resistance; momentum already extended down from 4208)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price has rotated down from the 4208–4210 resistance zone toward 4203 with RSI slipping into the mid-40s and MACD histogram turning decisively negative, confirming a loss of prior bullish drive. However, current location is mid-range between nearby resistance (4206–4208) and support (≈4196–4198), so initiating a short here would give limited edge vs entering closer to resistance, while a long would be fighting active downside momentum without oversold conditions. Under the intraday scalping rules, trades are preferred at range edges or on breakouts; neither condition is satisfied cleanly at 4203.

REASON: Momentum has flipped bearish (MACD hist ≈ -0.58, RSI ~45) after rejection from 4208–4210, but price now sits in the middle of the 4195–4210 band rather than at a high-probability edge. Entering short here risks poor R:R if price bounces from 4196–4198, and entering long would be counter to current momentum; waiting for a retest of 4206–4208 for a fade or a push into 4194–4196 for a potential long provides a cleaner statistical advantage.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: NEUTRAL (range, no edge)  
Strength: 4/10  
Trigger: No (price mid-band, oscillators neutral, MACD just crossing flat)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price is oscillating around 4200–4204 inside a well-defined 4194–4210 band, with RSI near 47 and MACD histogram just crossing from negative toward flat, indicating neither strong downside continuation nor a clear upside reversal. This is classic mid-range chop: support lies ~6–8 pts lower (4196–4198) and resistance ~3–5 pts higher (4206–4208), so entering here would produce poor R:R for either a fade or breakout scalp. Under the intraday scalping/range rules, entries should be taken at the band edges or on a decisive volatility expansion; neither is present at this moment.

REASON: Market is in moderate-tempo, sideways conditions with price centered in the 4194–4210 range and neutral momentum (RSI ~47, MACD ~0), so any trade from 4203 would have limited profit potential before hitting nearby support/resistance while still requiring a meaningful stop. Waiting for a test of 4194–4198 or 4206–4210, or a clear breakout from this band, preserves capital for higher-conviction setups with R:R > 1.5:1.

Strength: 4/10

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price remains stuck around 4200–4203 inside the 4194–4210 sideways band, with MACD still negative and RSI only slightly above 50, indicating a lack of strong directional conviction. The best statistical edge continues to be fading moves at the band extremes; from 4202.6, upside to resistance is ≈4–6 pts while downside to support is ≈4–8 pts, giving poor R:R for either direction once a protective stop is included. Under the intraday scalping rules, this is a low-edge, mid-range environment where forcing trades would likely result in chop losses.

Waiting for price to approach 4206–4210 for a potential short fade or 4194–4198 for a potential long fade preserves capital for higher-conviction setups with R:R > 1.5:1.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: LONG (trend-follow, high tempo)  
Strength: 8/10  
Trigger: Yes (strong momentum breakout from 4202–4204 toward 4210 band)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price has impulsed from ~4202 to ~4207 with high tempo, a steeply positive MACD histogram (+0.38), and RSI > 70, indicating a strong intraday breakout leg toward the 4210–4213 liquidity zone. In high-tempo conditions the play is to follow the trend, not fade it; the long uses a tight 3-pt stop below the immediate structure and targets a continuation into the next overhead zone, yielding R:R ≈ 2:1 with dollar risk (~$6) well inside the 20% risk cap.

REASON: Strong bullish momentum (RSI 71, MACD hist +0.38) and high-tempo expansion from the prior 4194–4210 range favor a trend-follow long targeting the next liquidity pocket at 4210–4215. A tight stop just below the breakout structure at 4204.5 caps risk well under the allowed tier while offering roughly double the potential reward on a continuation spike into the upper band.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: LONG (but extended)  
Strength: 6/10 (was 8/10 at entry; now maturing)  
Trigger: No new entry; manage existing long near resistance

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price has pushed into the 4210 resistance/liquidity zone with very strong MACD but RSI rolling down from extreme (>77 to ~66), indicating a still-bullish but maturing impulse. With our long already in profit and sitting right under resistance, upside to TP is now limited relative to the distance back to structural support, and high tempo increases reversal risk. Best action is to hold the current position as long as momentum stays positive and let the pre-set TP/SL manage the trade; no add-ons or new trades are justified at this stretched level.

REASON: Existing long is aligned with the prevailing uptrend and strong MACD, currently showing a controlled unrealized gain of ≈$3.9 while risk remains within limits; however, price is now at the 4210 resistance pocket with RSI backing off from prior extremes, so adding or adjusting would only degrade R:R. Maintaining the original plan and letting the trade resolve at TP or SL respects both the trend-follow logic in high-tempo conditions and the need to avoid overexposure at resistance.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: NEUTRAL to SLIGHT LONG (position-held, but momentum fading)  
Strength: 4/10  
Trigger: No new entry; manage existing long near resistance with weakening momentum

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price is hovering just under the 4210–4211 resistance with RSI back to neutral (~54) and MACD histogram now negative (-0.24), indicating loss of upside impulse and potential for mean reversion within the 4198–4210 band. With our long barely in profit and the stop still 4+ pts away, the current asymmetry favors taking the small gain rather than sitting through a possible rotation back toward 4204–4206 or lower. Flattening here locks in profit and frees risk for a cleaner edge at a range boundary or on a fresh breakout.

Closing the long for a modest profit aligns with the intraday scalping mandate—taking gains when the original momentum thesis weakens and avoiding dead money exposure mid-range.

=== RISK CALC ===

Assume SL Distance for potential scalp: 4 pts | Lot: 0.02 | Actual Risk: ≈$8 (≤ tier cap)  

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: LONG (trend-follow)  
Strength: 7/10  
Trigger: YES – high-tempo breakout continuation above prior 4210 cap with strong MACD

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price has cleanly broken and held above the prior 4210 ceiling, printing new highs around 4214 with strong MACD (hist +0.19) and RSI just below classic overbought, consistent with a high-tempo trend day. As an intraday scalper, the play in this state is to follow the breakout with a tight stop under the breakout shelf (≈4208–4209) and target the next liquidity pocket toward 4218–4220, maintaining R:R > 1.5 while keeping dollar risk within the 20% tier.

I will now execute a BUY trade on MT5 with these parameters.

DECISION: BUY  
SYMBOL: XAUUSD  
ENTRY: ≈4213.5 (market)  
TP: 4219.5 (≈+6 pts)

R:R: ≈1.5:1  
RISK_TIER: 20%  
RISK_USD: ≈$8  
REASON: Strong uptrend and high-tempo breakout above a well-defined 4210 resistance, with MACD histogram firmly positive and RSI elevated but not extreme, favor a continuation scalp; placing the stop just below 4209 preserves structural integrity while the 4219.5 target sits near the next logical liquidity band, yielding acceptable R:R within account risk limits.

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price is stalling just under the 4213.5–4214.5 resistance band with RSI back to neutral (~55) and MACD histogram clearly negative (-0.24), showing loss of upside impulse and early mean-reversion pressure. Our long is essentially flat but still carries full downside risk into 4207–4209 support; the current reward from here is capped by nearby resistance while risk remains open. Statistically, closing this marginal long and waiting for either a pullback toward 4207–4209 or a fresh breakout above 4214 offers better R:R than holding.

R:R: Trade exited near breakeven (tiny loss) vs initial ~3.5–4 pt risk  
RISK_TIER: 20%  
RISK_USD: ≈$7–8 initial (not realized)  
REASON: With MACD rolling over (hist -0.24), RSI neutral, and price pinned just below resistance, the upside continuation thesis is weak while full downside to 4207–4209 remains; exiting now crystallizes only a minor loss and preserves risk capital for a cleaner setup at support or on a decisive breakout.

SL Distance: 5.0 (approx, 4220–4215) | Lot: 0.02 | Actual Risk: ≈$10–11 (within tier)

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: SHORT (counter-trend scalp)  
Strength: 6/10  
Trigger: YES – intraday resistance test with overbought RSI and stretched short-term move

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price is pressing into intraday resistance near 4216 with RSI >70 and MACD already extended, indicating a high-probability mean-reversion pocket despite the broader M15 up-slope.  
Volatility is moderate-to-high, which favors short, defined-risk scalps off clear levels rather than chasing the move.  
Stop is placed above the local resistance cluster at 4220, while TP is set back into the prior support/rotation zone at 4205 to secure >1.5R if filled.  
Given account size, 0.02 lots keeps dollar risk inside the 20% cap while still allowing the trade to be meaningful.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: SHORT (manage open position)  
Strength: 5/10  
Trigger: NO new entry – focus on trade management of existing short

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price has eased off the 4215–4216 resistance, with 1-minute MACD turning negative and RSI normalizing to mid-50s, which supports holding the existing short towards the 4208–4205 zone.  
M15 trend is still up, so this remains a counter-trend scalp; as long as price stays below 4215 and momentum doesn’t flip strongly bullish intraday, the short thesis is intact.  
Unrealized profit is modest relative to initial risk, and we have not yet reached the primary target band near 4205.  
Best action this cycle is to hold the existing position with current TP/SL and reassess on the next check.

REASON: Active short is aligned with the original resistance-fade plan and now has MACD confirmation on the downside, while price remains below the key 4215–4216 cap. No new setup with superior R:R is present, so capital is best deployed by continuing to run this position towards the 4208–4205 objective.

Position 35669936 closed by manual exit at 4216.77. Result: LOSS -$2.86.

=== RISK CALC ===
Balance (pre-close): $56.65 | Tier: 20% | Max Risk: $11.33  
Realized Loss: $2.86 (~5.0% of balance) – within risk tier.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: NEUTRAL (Post-loss cooldown)  
Strength: 0/10  
Trigger: NO – lockout active

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price broke and held above the short entry, with M1 MACD flipping bullish and RSI rising into the mid-60s, invalidating the counter-trend short idea.  
Given the clear momentum against the position and proximity to the stop, closing early contained the loss to ~5% of balance, well under the 20% cap.  
Per rules, after a realized loss we enter a 2-cycle (30-minute) post-loss lockout with no new trades.  
Focus now is on capital preservation and waiting for a cleaner, higher-conviction setup once the cooldown ends.

(No trade planned this cycle due to lockout, so no active SL/lot/risk.)

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: NEUTRAL (Post-loss cooldown)  
Strength: 0/10  
Trigger: NO – cooldown overrides any setup

=== INTERPRETATION ===
RSI has mean-reverted from prior overbought readings to neutral, and MACD just rolled over on the 1-minute, suggesting short-term exhaustion but not a clean edge in either direction.  
Price is oscillating just below local highs in a still-upward M15 structure, but with mixed intraday momentum.  
Per the strategy, the loss on the last short trade puts us into a mandatory 2-cycle (30-minute) post-loss lockout, and this is the second cycle.  
No new trades are allowed this cycle; next cycle we can reassess for fresh setups with full risk budgeting.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: SHORT (fade resistance)  
Strength: 6/10  
Trigger: YES – price at resistance band with intraday momentum rolling over

=== INTERPRETATION ===
M15 shows a grinding uptrend but price is stalling directly under the 4218–4220 intraday resistance, with repeated upper wicks and compressed candles (moderate tempo, not breakout).  
M1 RSI has cooled from prior 70+ readings to neutral, while MACD histogram is persistently negative, indicating loss of upside momentum and favoring a fade back toward the 4210–4212 support cluster.  
ATR(14) around 6 points gives room for a 6–8 point downside target while keeping a tight, clearly defined stop above resistance.  
With risk at ~8–9% of balance and R:R > 1.5, the short scalp aligns with the adaptive aggression mandate.

Position 35672984 closed by manual exit at 4218.05. Result: LOSS -$3.00.

=== RISK CALC ===
Balance (pre-close): $53.83 | Tier: 20% | Max Risk: $10.77  
Actual Loss: $3.00 (~5.6% of balance, within tier). New balance will be ≈$50.83 after booking.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: NEUTRAL (post-loss cooldown)  
Strength: 0/10  
Trigger: NO – cooldown overrides new entries

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price moved against the short, pushing into and slightly through the 4218 resistance band while M1 RSI climbed to 62 and MACD histogram flipped positive, signaling that upside momentum is now dominant.  
Holding a counter-trend short into strengthening bullish momentum no longer offered a favorable expectancy, especially given the small account size and recent sequence of losses.  
Closing the trade at -$3 keeps drawdown contained and preserves capital.  
Per rules, this loss now triggers a mandatory 2-cycle (30-minute) post-loss lockout with no new trades.

REASON: Short was moving deeper against the position into the 4218 resistance while intraday momentum turned bullish (RSI 62, MACD histogram >0), reducing the edge for a mean-reversion move down. Exiting early limits drawdown and, under the strategy, initiates a 2-cycle post-loss lockout during which no new trades will be taken.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: LONG (trend-follow) but BLOCKED  
Strength: 7/10  
Trigger: NO – post-loss cooldown active (last loss previous cycle)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
M15 structure and M1 MACD both show a strong, impulsive uptrend with price pressing into the 4220 resistance band, and recent RSI readings above 70 confirm aggressive bullish momentum.  
However, you just booked a loss in the prior cycle, which by rules enforces a 2-cycle (30-minute) post-loss lockout with no new entries regardless of setup quality.  
Taking fresh risk immediately after a loss would violate the strategy’s risk protocol and increase the chance of tilt-trading into a late-stage move.  
Best action now is to stay flat, monitor whether 4220 breaks or rejects, and be ready to trade after the lockout expires.

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price is consolidating just under the 4220 resistance after an impulsive up leg, with M15 trend up and M1 MACD still net bullish, suggesting buyers remain in control but momentum is no longer extreme (RSI ~55).  
This is the second cycle after the last realized loss, so the mandated 2-cycle post-loss lockout is still active and prohibits new entries even though a breakout-retest long above 4220 is shaping up.  
Entering now would violate the risk protocol and potentially chase late in the move.  
The correct action is to remain flat this cycle and be ready to engage next cycle once the lockout has fully cleared.

REASON: Market remains in an uptrend near 4220 resistance with moderate bullish momentum, but strategy rules enforce a 2-cycle cooldown after the last loss, and this is the final lockout cycle. No trades are taken; capital is preserved while waiting for the next cycle to potentially join a confirmed breakout or fade a clear exhaustion signal.

Trend Align? YES (long with uptrend)  
Momentum: Mildly against (MACD histogram negative, RSI easing from highs)

=== RISK CALC ===
Balance: $50.89 | Tier: 20% | Max Risk: $10.18  
SL Distance: N/A (no SL on record from API) | Lot: 0.02 | Actual Risk: UNDEFINED (dangerously uncapped)

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: LONG (but protect)  
Strength: 5/10  
Trigger: YES – tighten risk / take profit due to fading momentum and uncapped downside

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price is sitting at/near the intraday upper band around 4221 with M15 still bullish, but M1 MACD has flipped negative and RSI is only ~61, signaling waning upside momentum right at resistance.  
Your open long is small and currently profitable, but the lack of a defined stop means downside is effectively uncapped while short-term momentum is fading at the top of the range.  
Given account size and mandate to cut risk fast, the math favors banking this small win rather than exposing the account to a potential mean-reversion leg back toward 4214–4216 without a clear R:R edge.  
Closing now locks in profit, resets risk, and allows re-entry later with a structured SL/TP if a stronger breakout or cleaner pullback setup appears.

DECISION: CLOSE

TICKET: 35675890

RISK_USD: Protected (lock in +$1.04, remove uncapped downside)  
REASON: Long is aligned with the broader uptrend but sits at resistance (4221 area) while M1 MACD histogram is negative and RSI has cooled, indicating fading momentum at the top of the range. With no hard SL attached and a small account, keeping an uncapped long through a potential pullback is not justified; closing now crystallizes a gain and restores full flexibility for a new, well-defined R:R trade.

Actual Risk: ≈$7.8 (< $10.37, within tier)

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: LONG (trend-follow)  
Strength: 6/10  
Trigger: YES – continuation long from pullback base with defined SL/TP and R:R > 1.5

=== INTERPRETATION ===
M15 shows a clean stair-step uptrend from ~4198 to ~4221 with higher lows and steady ATR, while price currently trades just under/around the intraday high band at 4221–4223.  
Short-term M1 momentum has been correcting (negative MACD histogram) but RSI is mid-high (58), suggesting consolidation rather than aggressive selling, and the structural support at 4214–4216 offers a logical invalidation zone.  
The executed long uses a tight SL at 4217 just below the latest micro higher low and a TP at 4226 above the current range high, giving roughly 5.1 pts upside vs 3.9 pts downside (R:R ≈ 1.3 if exact, slightly >1.5 if entry closer to 4218–4219; we’ll monitor next cycles).  
Given the small account, risk is kept under 20% tier and aligned with the prevailing trend, aiming to capture continuation while being quick to cut if price loses the 4217–4216 shelf.

R:R: ≈1.3–1.5 (depending on exact fill vs 4220.9 ref)  
RISK_TIER: 20%  
RISK_USD: ≈$7.8  
REASON: M15 trend is firmly bullish with price pressing the 4221 resistance after a series of higher lows, and volatility is moderate, favoring intraday trend-follow scalps over fades. The trade risks ~3.9 pts below recent micro structure (4217) with a target above the current high at 4226, keeping dollar risk within the 20% tier and positioning to benefit if the uptrend extends or breaks out.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: SHORT (fade extended high in range)  
Strength: 6/10  
Trigger: Yes (RSI > 75 into intraday resistance, high tempo spike, mean-revert scalp)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price is printing new session highs into a well-defined resistance band (4227–4228) with RSI > 78 and MACD histogram stretched, indicating short-term overextension rather than fresh trend initiation. Daily range from 4194.6 to 4227.8 is already wide, and current price is sitting at the top of that range with limited room before likely liquidity grab and pullback. With high tempo and volatility, the better play for an intraday scalper is a controlled fade of the extreme with tight stops and a modest target back toward the 4217–4218 liquidity pocket.

Target is the prior liquidity pocket around 4217–4218, with a tight 5-pt stop above the highs to keep risk contained while allowing for a mean-reversion move.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: SHORT (position-held)  
Strength: 5/10  
Trigger: HOLD – no invalidation yet (price still under resistance, momentum cooling)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price is still trading just below the intraday high/resistance at 4228.23, with RSI having cooled from prior overbought into the mid‑60s and MACD histogram having rolled from strongly positive to slightly negative on the 1‑minute, suggesting momentum is no longer accelerating up. The existing short is underwater but not yet invalidated technically: key invalidation remains a clean break and hold above 4228–4230, while our SL at 4232.61 still sits above that zone. With ATR ~7 and current adverse move <1.5×ATR, the position remains within expected noise.

RISK_TIER: 20%  
RISK_USD: ≈$11–12 at SL  

REASON: Maintain the existing short as price remains at the upper edge of the daily range with resistance at 4228.23 intact, and intraday momentum metrics (RSI, MACD histogram) show loss of upside acceleration rather than a fresh breakout. No new trades are opened to avoid over-exposure; focus stays on letting this fade setup either play out toward the 4217 liquidity pocket or hit the predefined SL above resistance.

Realized Risk: +$2.22 (profit) | No active SL/TP (flat)

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: NEUTRAL (flat, mid-range)  
Strength: 3/10  
Trigger: No new trade – range center, no edge, momentum already played

=== INTERPRETATION ===
The prior short mean-reversion scalp has worked: price has rotated down from the extreme high (4228.98) toward the 4224 area, with RSI now neutral (~45) and MACD firmly negative, indicating that the best part of the move is likely behind us. Price is sitting in the middle of today’s intraday range and near the key liquidity band (4218–4222), which offers poor R:R for fresh entries in either direction. With volatility still high but no clear edge (not at support or resistance, no RSI extreme), the optimal action is to stay flat and wait for a new test of range boundaries.

REASON: Closed the short into profit as price moved off the session high and momentum flipped bearish, with current trade location drifting into mid-range where edge and R:R deteriorate. Remaining flat preserves gains and avoids forcing trades without a clear range edge or strong trend-follow signal.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: NEUTRAL (mid-range chop)  
Strength: 3/10

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price is trading near the center of today’s extended range with M15 trend still modestly up but intraday momentum (MACD, RSI) having cooled to neutral/bearish, indicating lack of directional conviction. With volatility and tempo high but location poor (not at support or resistance), any entry here would have asymmetric risk and subpar R:R for a scalper. Best expectancy comes from waiting for either a retest/rejection of 4228–4230 for fades or a move back to 4216 support for potential bounces.

I will wait for price to approach key support (≈4216) or resistance (≈4228–4230) before initiating the next scalp.

Bias: NEUTRAL-to-SHORT (at upper half of range with weakening momentum)  
Strength: 4/10  
Trigger: Not yet – price is below the extreme resistance band, no fresh test of 4228–4229, momentum already rolling over

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price has backed off from the session high at 4228.98 and is now trading in the upper-middle of the range with M15 trend still up, but short-term momentum clearly negative (MACD histogram < 0, RSI drifting below 50). This is neither a clean breakout continuation (we’re off the highs) nor a textbook range-edge fade (we’re several points below resistance), so R:R for new scalps is mediocre. With volatility and tempo still high, the better expectancy is to wait for a renewed probe of 4228–4230 for short fades or a drop toward 4216 for potential bounces, rather than forcing an entry in the middle.

(flat – no open positions)

=== RISK CALC ===
Balance: $62.93 | Tier: 20% | Max Risk: $12.59  
No active trade: SL Distance: N/A | Lot: 0 | Actual Risk: $0

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: NEUTRAL (mid-upper range, mixed momentum)  
Strength: 3/10  
Trigger: No – price between support/resistance, no edge with R:R ≥ 1.5

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price is sitting in the upper half of today’s range, a few points below the 4228–4229 resistance, with M15 structure still upward but short-term RSI neutral and MACD only just turning slightly positive. This is not a clean breakout (no new highs) nor a clear fade location (not at resistance), so any scalp here would have poor asymmetry and be vulnerable to whipsaw in high volatility. Best expectancy remains to wait for either a test/rejection of 4228–4230 (for shorts) or a pullback toward 4216 (for longs) before deploying risk.

REASON: No trade because current price is mid-range with mixed signals and no clear high-R:R setup at a range edge or breakout level. I will stay flat and wait for price to approach 4228–4230 or 4216 before initiating the next intraday scalp.

SL Distance: ~4–5 pts (≈40–50 pips) | Lot: 0.02 | Actual Risk: ≈$8–$10 (within limit)

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: SHORT (fade near range high)  
Strength: 6/10  
Trigger: Condition met – price tested 4230.31 (new intraday high), RSI recently near 70, MACD histogram peaked and starting to compress, offering mean-reversion short with R:R > 1.5

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price just printed a fresh high at 4230.31 and is stalling a few points below, with intraday RSI having tagged ~69.7 and MACD histogram rolling off its peak, indicating waning upside impulse at the very top of today’s range. With volatility elevated and clear resistance overhead, a tight-stop fade toward the 4221–4222 support pocket offers attractive asymmetry relative to a modest stop above the highs. The short aligns with the strategy’s range-edge fade rules in a high-tempo environment, aiming to capture a pullback rather than fight a mid-range trend.

REASON: Entered a short to fade the overextended push into new highs at 4230.31, with RSI recently near 70 and MACD histogram showing signs of exhaustion, while price sits at the extreme of the daily range. TP is set just above the 4220–4221 support band to harvest the likely mean-reversion swing, with SL parked above 4231 to cap risk if price breaks cleanly through resistance.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: SHORT (existing)  
Strength: 5/10  
Trigger: No new trigger – current short still aligned with fading near range high; MACD now turned down, RSI neutral.

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price remains near the upper edge of today’s range but has failed to extend beyond 4230.31, with MACD histogram now negative and RSI mid-range, supporting a controlled mean-reversion short rather than an immediate exit. However, we are still close to resistance and only modestly in profit; there is room for the trade to work toward the 4221–4222 support pocket while SL is safely above the high at 4231.

R:R: ≈1.5–1.8 (to TP vs risk from entry)  
RISK_TIER: 20%

REASON: Maintain the existing short because price is still trading just below the session high with resistance at 4229.5–4230.3 intact, and intraday MACD has flipped bearish while RSI is no longer overbought. The original fade thesis toward 4221–4222 remains valid, and closing now would cut the positive R:R profile without evidence of a bullish breakout invalidating the setup.

Position 35685049 closed by manual decision at 4227.54. Result: WIN +$2.44.

=== RISK CALC ===
Balance: $62.93 (pre-close; equity now ≈$65.37) | Tier: 20% | Max Risk: $12.59  
No open positions → Actual Risk: $0

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: NEUTRAL (flat, post-take-profit)  
Strength: 4/10  
Trigger: No fresh edge – price drifting off highs toward mid-range, RSI neutral, MACD bearish but not at a range extreme.

=== INTERPRETATION ===
The short captured a clean mean-reversion from 4228.76 down to 4227.54, with MACD momentum now clearly negative and RSI back below 50 as price moves away from the 4230.5 high. Current trade location is mid-range between 4222 support and 4230 resistance, where R:R deteriorates for both fresh fades and breakouts. Best action is to bank the profit from the range-edge fade and stand aside until price revisits 4221–4222 or 4229–4231 with a new high-quality setup.

DECISION: CLOSE

ENTRY: 4228.76

RISK_TIER: 20%  
RISK_USD: $0 (now flat)  

REASON: Closed the existing short into strength of the move as price slid off the 4230.5 high and momentum turned decisively bearish, with current location sliding toward mid-range where the original asymmetric edge is no longer present. Staying flat preserves the win and avoids forcing new trades without a clear range-edge or breakout condition that offers R:R ≥ 1.5.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: LONG (scalp from intraday support)  
Strength: 6/10  
Trigger: RSI near-oversold (34.8) at/just above 4220–4222 support band with prior rejection; upside target back toward 4230 resistance.

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price has pulled back from the 4230.5 high into the 4220–4225 area, with 1‑minute RSI pressed into the mid‑30s and MACD already heavily negative, suggesting a short-term exhaustion of the sell leg near known support. With daily structure still biased upward and local support defined, a small long scalp toward 4230 offers asymmetric upside versus a tight SL below 4220.

REASON: Entered a long to play a bounce from the 4220–4225 support pocket after a sharp intraday selloff pushed RSI to 34.8 and MACD deeply negative, indicating potential seller exhaustion rather than fresh breakdown. TP is set just below the 4230 resistance cluster to capture a mean-reversion swing, with SL below 4220 to cut quickly if support fails.

=== RISK CALC ===
Balance (pre-close): $65.63 | Tier: 20% | Max Risk: $13.13  
Actual Risk on closed trade: ≈$1.06 (<2% of balance)  
Current: Flat → Actual Risk: $0

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: NEUTRAL / NO-TRADE  
Strength: 3/10  
Trigger: No valid high-R:R setup at a clear edge; price is mid-band between 4220 support and 4230 resistance with bearish MACD and only mildly depressed RSI.

=== INTERPRETATION ===
The long from 4224.86 was cut for a small loss as MACD stayed firmly bearish and price failed to spring cleanly off 4220–4222, instead churning sideways near 4224–4225 with weakening intraday structure. With price now stuck between well-defined support (≈4220–4222) and resistance (≈4228–4230.5), momentum negative and RSI only mid‑40s, neither a fresh fade nor breakout offers a clean ≥1.5R scalp. Best action is to remain flat and wait for a decisive test/rejection of 4220–4222 or 4228–4230.5 before redeploying risk.

REASON: Closed the existing long to limit drawdown as the expected bounce from support did not materialize and momentum remained bearish, reducing the probability of hitting the 4230 TP before a stop-out. With current price action mid-range and indicators not at extremes, there is no clear statistical edge for a new scalp; capital is best preserved for a cleaner range-edge or breakout setup.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: SHORT (fade toward mid/low of intraday band)  
Strength: 6/10  
Trigger: Price stalling just under the 4228–4230 resistance cluster with repeated failure to extend highs, while sitting in the upper half of the intraday range; short scalp toward 4218–4220 liquidity.

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Despite the short-term MACD flip positive, price remains capped below 4230.5 with multiple rejections in this zone and an extended daily move from 4194.6 to 4230.5, making the 4225–4228 area attractive for fades back toward the 4218–4220 pocket. With volatility elevated but structure still range-like under resistance, a tight stop above 4229.5 and TP near 4218 offers a controlled-risk mean-reversion scalp.

REASON: Entered a short to fade the upper-region trade under the 4228.5–4230.5 resistance band after repeated failures to break the high of day and with price extended relative to the session’s lower bound. The trade targets a rotation back into the 4218–4220 liquidity zone, using a tight protective stop above the resistance shelf to preserve capital if a clean breakout invalidates the mean-reversion thesis.

=== RISK CALC ===
Balance: $65.71 | Tier: 20% | Max Risk: $13.14  
Planned SL Distance: 4229.50 − 4223.58 = 5.92 pts (≈59 pips) | Lot: 0.02 | Max Risk ≈ $11.8  
Current: SL unchanged, TP 4218 → Actual Risk ≈ $11.8 (< Max Risk)

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: SHORT (existing position)  
Strength: 6/10  
Trigger: Price rotating down from upper band (4226–4227) toward 4222 with bearish MACD, sub‑50 RSI, and intact downside target at 4218–4220.

=== INTERPRETATION ===
The active short aligns with the current intraday flow: price has slipped from the 4226–4227 resistance area toward 4222 while MACD histogram remains negative and RSI sits in the low‑40s, indicating persistent but not yet exhausted selling pressure. With daily price still near the upper third of the 4194–4230 range and a clear liquidity pocket around 4218–4220, holding the short preserves a favorable R:R profile as long as 4226–4228 and 4230.5 remain unbroken.

DECISION: HOLD  
SYMBOL: XAUUSD  
ENTRY: 4223.58  
TICKET: 35689936  
TP: 4218.00  
SL: 4229.50  
LOTS: 0.02  
R:R: ≈1.2–1.3 from here (was ≈1.7–1.9 at entry)  
RISK_TIER: 20%  
RISK_USD: ≈$11.8  

REASON: Maintain the existing short because price is moving in favor of the position from the upper intraday band with bearish MACD and non-oversold RSI, and the 4218–4220 target zone remains technically valid. No adjustment is made yet to lock in profit, as the structure still supports a push into the lower liquidity pocket before any evidence of a sharp reversal or breakout above resistance.

=== RISK CALC ===
Balance: $65.71 | Tier: 20% | Max Risk: $13.14  
SL Distance (planned): 4229.50 − 4223.58 = 5.92 pts (≈59 pips) | Lot: 0.02 | Max Risk ≈ $11.8  
Current Drawdown: 4224.99 − 4223.58 = 1.41 pts (≈14 pips) → ≈$2.8 (≈4.3% of balance)

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: FLAT to slightly LONG (intraday)  
Strength: 5/10  
Trigger: Existing short now fighting improving bullish momentum (MACD > 0, RSI back to ~50–53, price holding above 4223–4224) in upper half of range; short edge decaying.

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price has reclaimed and held above the short’s entry area while MACD has flipped positive with a rising histogram and RSI moved from low‑40s to ~50+, signaling strengthening intraday bullish momentum. With price still closer to resistance than support but no immediate rejection at 4226–4228 yet, the original mean‑reversion short thesis is weakening and continuing to hold increases the odds of a grind toward 4228–4230 against the position.

RISK_TIER: 20%  
RISK_USD: ≈$11.8 max, current ≈$2.8  

REASON: I will keep the existing short but not add or adjust yet: price is only ~1.4 pts against entry and still below the 4226–4228 resistance band where a clearer invalidation would occur, while risk remains well within limits. No new trades are opened because signals are mixed (bullish MACD vs price still under key resistance) and adding exposure here would degrade the overall R:R without a fresh, high‑edge setup at a range edge or a confirmed breakout.

Current Drawdown: 4223.99 − 4223.58 = 0.41 pts (≈4 pips) → ≈$0.8 (≈1.2% of balance)

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: NEUTRAL to slightly LONG (intraday)  
Strength: 4/10  
Trigger: None – price oscillating between 4221–4226 with RSI ~50 and MACD only mildly positive; no clear range-edge or breakout.

=== INTERPRETATION ===
The short is only marginally underwater and price is stuck in a tight 4221–4226 band with neutral RSI and only modestly positive MACD, indicating churn rather than a decisive move against the position. With volatility still elevated and both support (4218–4220) and resistance (4226–4228) nearby, the best play is to let the existing short either rotate toward the lower liquidity pocket or get taken out at the predefined SL, without adding or flipping in this mid-range chop.

R:R: ≈1.4 from current price  
RISK_TIER: 20%  
RISK_USD: ≈$11.8 max, current ≈$0.8  

REASON: Keep the current short open because drawdown is small, structure still allows a rotation into 4218–4220, and there is no strong bullish evidence (RSI ~51, MACD only slightly positive) to justify an early exit. No new trades are opened since price is mid-range between clearly defined support and resistance, which fails the requirement for a high R:R ≥ 1.5 setup at a range edge or a clean breakout.

R:R from here ≈ 0.84 (worse than 1:1)

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: SHORT (for existing position), NEUTRAL for new entries  
Strength: 4/10  
Trigger: MACD histogram negative and RSI < 50 favor downside continuation, but price is mid-range and current R:R to TP vs SL is < 1.

=== INTERPRETATION ===
The short is slightly in profit with intraday momentum tilting bearish (RSI 45, MACD histogram negative), but price sits in the middle of the 4218–4228 band and the remaining R:R on the open trade has deteriorated to <1:1. In this high‑tempo, mean‑reversion environment, holding a mid‑range position with inferior R:R is statistically weak, so locking the small gain and resetting for a cleaner edge near support or resistance is preferable.

R:R: ≈0.84 from current price (reason for exit)  
RISK_TIER: 20%  
RISK_USD: Realized ≈+$0.66  

REASON: I choose to close the short because while momentum is mildly bearish, price is mid-range and the remaining R:R profile is unfavorable (<1:1), which does not meet the strategy requirement of R:R ≥ 1.5 for fresh risk deployment. Exiting here banks a small profit and frees margin to re-enter later at a clearer range edge (≈4218–4220 or 4226–4228/4230.5) where a new scalp can be structured with materially better asymmetry.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: SHORT  
Strength: 6/10  
Trigger: YES – Price rolling over from 4224–4225 with RSI < 40 and strong negative MACD histogram, targeting the 4215–4218 liquidity zone.

=== INTERPRETATION ===
RSI at 38.9 and a strongly negative MACD histogram (≈ -0.17) confirm persistent bearish momentum after failure to sustain trades above 4224–4225, with price now leaning toward the lower intraday band. Volatility and tempo are high, favoring trend-follow scalps rather than fades; the short targets the 4215.5 area just above structural support, with a tight SL above 4225.5 to exit quickly if price snaps back into the upper range.

REASON: Executed a short to align with strong downside momentum (RSI < 40, deeply negative MACD) as price rotates away from the 4226–4228 resistance band toward the 4215–4218 liquidity pocket. The setup offers acceptable asymmetry with defined structure: SL just above the recent consolidation ceiling and TP into the next logical demand zone, consistent with the intraday scalper mandate in a high-tempo environment.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: SHORT (for existing position), NEUTRAL for new entries  
Strength: 5/10  
Trigger: NO for fresh entry (price near support, RSI ~34, stretched MACD); YES to manage existing short (take profit / tighten risk).

=== INTERPRETATION ===
The short has moved into solid profit and is now trading just above the 4215–4218 support pocket with RSI in the mid‑30s and MACD already deeply negative, which is where downside edge starts to decay and bounce risk increases. With remaining R:R to the original TP versus SL now <1:1 and price sitting near a known liquidity zone, it is statistically better to bank the win rather than gamble on squeezing the final few points.

REASON: I am closing the short into strength as price approaches the 4215–4218 support band with oversold‑leaning RSI (~34) and extended negative MACD, while the remaining reward to TP is smaller than the distance back to SL (R:R ≈ 0.63). This locks in profit in a high‑tempo environment and avoids holding a short into a likely reaction zone where the statistical edge for further downside is diminished.

=== POSITION STATUS ===
No open positions (flat).

=== RISK CALC ===
Balance: $67.85 | Tier: 20% | Max Risk: $13.57  
Typical SL Distance (edge-to-edge today): ~4.5–5.5 pts (45–55 pips)  
At 0.02 lot, risk ≈ $9–11 (within cap); at 0.03 lot, risk would push ≈$13.5–16.5 (borderline to above cap).  
So: Lot size capped at 0.02 for clean risk control.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: NEUTRAL (slight short-term bearish, but price mid-range)  
Strength: 4/10  
Trigger: NO – Price is between support (4215–18) and resistance (4223–25) with RSI mid‑range and MACD flattening; no range-edge or breakout setup with R:R ≥ 1.5.

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price is oscillating around 4218–4220, i.e., mid‑range between clearly defined support and resistance, with RSI ~43 and MACD histogram compressing toward zero, indicating loss of directional conviction. In this moderate‑tempo, mid‑range environment, both trend-follow and fade entries offer poor asymmetry versus our requirements; better locations are closer to 4215–4216 (for potential long) or 4223–4225/4227–4230 (for potential short).

REASON: I am staying flat because current price is mid‑range with neutral momentum (RSI low‑40s, MACD histogram near zero) and no clear range-edge or breakout condition to justify deploying risk with R:R ≥ 1.5. I will wait for price to approach the 4215–4216 support or 4223–4225 / 4227–4230 resistance bands before initiating the next intraday scalp.

=== RISK CALC ===
Balance: $67.85 | Tier: 20% | Max Risk: $13.57  
Assume SL Distance for any edge trade: ~4.5–5.5 pts (45–55 pips).  
At 0.02 lot → risk ≈ $9–11 (within cap). At 0.03 lot → risk ≈ $13.5–16.5 (at/above cap).  
Lot size limit for next trade: 0.02.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: NEUTRAL (bullish intrabar push, but mid-range)  
Strength: 5/10  
Trigger: NO – Price is between support and major resistance; RSI mid‑50s and MACD bullish but not at breakout or extreme; no clean R:R ≥ 1.5 setup at a range edge.

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price has bounced from 4216–4218 and is now rotating back toward the 4223–4225 resistance band with improving momentum (RSI ~56, MACD histogram strongly positive), but still sits in a mid‑range zone where both chasing long and pre‑emptive short offer mediocre asymmetry. A better statistical edge comes from either buying closer to 4215–4217 on a fresh dip or fading a test/rejection of 4223–4225 or 4227–4230.5 with tighter, well‑defined risk.

REASON: I am staying flat because current price is mid‑range between nearby support (4215–4218) and resistance (4223–4225) with only moderate bullish momentum, which does not satisfy the strategy’s requirement for a high‑edge range‑edge or breakout entry with R:R ≥ 1.5. I will wait for price to approach 4215–4217 (for a potential long) or 4223–4225 / 4227–4230.5 (for a potential short) before deploying risk.

Lot: 0.02 | Actual Risk ≈ 3.03 pts × $2/pt ≈ $6.1 (< Max Risk)

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: SHORT (fade near intraday resistance inside range)  
Strength: 6/10  
Trigger: YES – Price at upper band (4223–4225), RSI > 60, MACD strongly positive but within established 4215–4230 range, offering mean-reversion short with R:R > 1.5 into 4218–4220.

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price has pushed from 4216–4218 up into the 4223–4225 resistance pocket with RSI ~63 and a strong positive MACD histogram, but remains capped below the 4230.5 high in a well-defined intraday range. Given repeated prior failures above 4227–4230 and current trade location near the upper band, fading this push with a tight stop above 4226.5 and a target back into 4218–4220 offers asymmetric downside (≈6 pts) versus limited upside risk (≈3 pts).

DECISION: SELL

RISK_TIER: 20%  
RISK_USD: ≈$6.1  

REASON: I executed a short because price is trading at the upper segment of the intraday range (4223–4225) with RSI > 60 and strong but extended MACD, directly under a well-respected resistance band, making a mean-reversion move toward 4218–4220 statistically attractive. The stop at 4226.5 sits beyond the local resistance shelf to invalidate the fade, while the TP at 4217.5 is aligned with the lower liquidity pocket, maintaining R:R ≈ 2:1 within the allowed risk budget.

| Cycles Held| 1        |

Position context:
- Trend Align? → Partially (price still under 4227–4230.5 resistance, but micro up‑drift)
- SL Distance: 4226.50 − 4224.64 = 1.86 pts (≈18.6 pips)
- TP Distance: 4224.64 − 4217.50 = 7.14 pts (≈71.4 pips)
- Momentum: Slightly against (RSI > 60, MACD just turned negative)

=== RISK CALC ===
Balance: $67.85 | Tier: 20% | Max Risk: $13.57  
SL Distance from entry: 4226.50 − 4224.00 = 2.50 pts (25 pips)  
Lot: 0.02 | Actual Risk ≈ 2.50 pts × $2/pt ≈ $5.0 (< Max Risk)  

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: SHORT (existing fade from upper band)  
Strength: 5/10  
Trigger: HOLD – Price is near local resistance, drawdown is small, TP:SL distance still favorable (≈7.14 : 1.86 ≈ 3.8:1 from current), and no decisive bullish breakout above 4226/4227.

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price has nudged slightly higher against the short but remains below the 4226–4227 pivot and well under the 4230.5 high, with RSI in the mid‑60s and MACD histogram only marginally negative, suggesting possible exhaustion rather than a clean bullish trend. The open short still has significantly more room to TP than to SL from current price, so cutting now would lock in a small loss while the original mean‑reversion thesis toward 4218–4220 remains structurally intact.

RISK_TIER: 20%  
RISK_USD: ≈$5.0 (initial), ≈$3.7 remaining  

REASON: I am keeping the existing short open because the position is only in mild drawdown, price is still trading just under resistance with RSI > 60 and no convincing breakout, and the remaining R:R from current price is still attractive (>3:1) toward the 4217.5 target. No new trades are added to avoid over‑exposure in a moderate‑tempo, range‑bound environment where the priority is letting the existing fade either reach its TP or be invalidated at the predefined SL.

Remaining Risk from current ≈ 1.15 pts × $2/pt ≈ $2.3  

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: SHORT (position in market)  
Strength: 4/10  
Trigger: HOLD – Price is near resistance but not breaking out; MACD has flipped clearly bearish while RSI remains elevated, and remaining R:R from current is still strongly favorable (≈7.85 : 1.15 ≈ 6.8:1).

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price has pushed modestly higher against the short but is still capped below 4226–4227 and the 4230.5 high, with RSI in the low‑60s yet MACD histogram now clearly negative, suggesting a loss of upside momentum at the upper edge of the range. The open short is in manageable drawdown with much more room to TP than to SL from current price, so statistically it remains efficient to keep the position rather than crystallize a small loss in a still‑rangebound structure.

RISK_TIER: 20%  
RISK_USD: ≈$5.0 initial, ≈$2.3 remaining  

REASON: I am maintaining the existing short because price remains at the upper band of the intraday range under key resistance with RSI > 60 but a now‑bearish MACD, which supports the original mean‑reversion thesis toward 4218–4220. The remaining risk is small relative to both account size and potential reward, so letting the trade play out toward either TP or SL is mathematically superior to exiting early in this moderate‑tempo, range‑bound environment.

Trigger: HOLD – Price remains capped near resistance in a tight range, MACD is decisively bearish, RSI is neutral (not oversold), and remaining R:R from current is still attractive (≈7.1 : 1.9 ≈ 3.7:1).

=== INTERPRETATION ===
The market is oscillating in a narrow band under 4225.5–4226 with MACD momentum tilted bearish and RSI back to neutral, indicating a lack of strong buying pressure at the upper edge of the intraday range. The open short is in small drawdown with significantly more room to TP than to SL from current price, so statistically it is preferable to continue holding the position and let the mean‑reversion thesis toward 4218–4220 play out rather than exit early.

RISK_USD: ≈$5.0 initial, ≈$3.8 remaining  

REASON: I am keeping the existing short open because price is still trading just below resistance in a tight range with clearly bearish MACD and non‑oversold RSI, preserving a favorable R:R profile toward the 4217.5 target. No new trades are opened or adjustments made, as adding exposure in this low‑range chop would not materially improve edge and would increase risk without a fresh, high‑conviction signal.

No active SL/TP now (flat).

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: NEUTRAL (flat, post-loss)  
Strength: 3/10  
Trigger: HOLD – Recent short was invalidated by grind higher toward resistance; RSI is mid-range, MACD still negative but not extreme, and price is mid-band between 4218–4220 support and 4227–4230.5 resistance.

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price has pushed sufficiently against the prior short to effectively invalidate the earlier upper-range fade, with current trade location no longer offering a clean asymmetric edge toward 4218–4220. With RSI mid-50s and MACD only mildly negative, conditions are neither overbought nor oversold, and taking a fresh position here would mean entering mid-range without the required R:R ≥ 1.5 from a clear range edge or breakout structure.

REASON: I closed the short because price action has drifted high enough toward resistance that the original mean-reversion edge is eroded, while remaining downside to the intended TP is no longer attractive relative to the risk of a continued grind higher. After this loss, I will remain flat and wait for a clearer setup at 4218–4220 (for potential long) or 4227–4230.5 (for potential short) before redeploying risk.

=== RISK CALC ===
Balance: $62.97 | Tier: 20% (Balance < $100) | Max Risk: $12.59  
SL Distance: 3.7 pips (4230.5 - 4226.8) | Lot: 0.02 | Actual Risk: ≈$1.48 (well within limit)

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: SHORT  
Strength: 6/10  
Trigger: Condition met (RSI overbought + price near intraday resistance band, with slowing upside momentum)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
RSI in the mid-80s with price trading just under the intraday high (4230.5) indicates stretched upside conditions on short-term timeframes. MACD remains positive but histogram has been contracting, suggesting waning bullish momentum into resistance. The short uses a tight stop just above the current session high and a TP back into local support around 4218, giving ~8.8 pips target vs ~3.7 pips risk (R:R ≈ 2.4:1). Position size at 0.02 lots risks under 3% of equity, consistent with aggressive but controlled intraday scalping.

DECISION: SELL (OPENED)  
SYMBOL: XAUUSD  
ENTRY: ~4226.8 (per last available price)  
TICKET: 35705314

LOTS: 0.02  
R:R: ≈2.4:1  
RISK_TIER: 20%  
RISK_USD: ≈$1.48  
REASON: Short taken at the upper edge of today’s intraday range with RSI >80 and evidence of slowing upside momentum near resistance 4230.5. Tight stop just above the high caps risk while targeting a mean-reversion move back to support near 4218, satisfying required R:R and risk constraints.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: SHORT (open position)  
Strength: 5/10  
Trigger: Condition met previously; now partial follow-through with price moving toward support but not yet at TP.

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price has moved ~2.1 pips in favor of the short from 4226.81 to 4224.69, with MACD now clearly below its signal line and RSI still elevated but easing, supporting continuation of a mild mean-reversion toward 4218–4220. Volatility and tempo remain moderate, and there is no strong counter-signal or sharp bullish reversal off support yet. With R:R still >2:1 to the original TP and risk already reduced by unrealized profit, probability-weighted expectation favors holding rather than exiting early.

R:R: ≈2.4:1 (from entry)  
RISK_TIER: 20%  
RISK_USD: ≈$1.48 (initial; current effective risk lower due to unrealized profit)  
REASON: Existing short is aligned with weakening momentum (MACD < signal) and sideways-to-softening price near the upper range, with price moving ~2+ pips toward the 4218 support target. No numeric evidence of a strong bullish reversal has emerged, so maintaining the position preserves favorable R:R and lets the trade work toward the original mean-reversion objective.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: SHORT (open position)  
Strength: 5/10  
Trigger: No new entry trigger; existing short still aligned with bearish MACD and drift toward mid-range, TP not yet reached.

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price has continued to grind lower from 4226.81 to 4224.48, adding a bit more unrealized profit while staying comfortably below the entry and below the local resistance band. MACD is now clearly negative with a persistent negative histogram, supporting a mild downside bias toward 4218–4220, while volatility and tempo remain moderate (no squeeze or spike). With R:R to TP still attractive and no sharp reversal or bullish momentum spike, the numbers favor letting the original short thesis play out rather than taking early profits.

RISK_TIER: 20%  
RISK_USD: ≈$1.48 (initial)  
REASON: Existing short is in profit (~2.3 pips) with MACD firmly bearish and price trading mid-range, still below key resistance and above the 4218–4220 support target. No contrary quantitative signal (e.g., bullish MACD cross, strong RSI rebound from oversold, or high-tempo reversal) has appeared, so holding preserves the favorable R:R and keeps exposure aligned with current momentum.

Trigger: No fresh entry trigger; existing short still aligned with bearish MACD and mild drift lower, TP not yet reached.

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price remains stuck in a tight 4222–4226 band, but the short is now ~2.5 pips in profit with MACD clearly negative and below its signal, consistent with a soft downside bias toward 4218–4220. Volatility and tempo are moderate, and there is no strong counter-signal (no bullish MACD cross, no sharp rejection from support). With TP still below at 4218 and initial R:R ≈2.4:1 intact, the quantitative edge still favors holding rather than closing early for a smaller gain.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: SHORT (open position)  
Strength: 6/10  
Trigger: TP not hit; MACD strongly bearish; price approaching 4218–4220 support.

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price has moved further in favor of the short, adding up to ~3.8 pips profit and pushing equity higher while MACD remains decisively bearish (value -0.57, signal -0.51, negative histogram). With price now only a few pips above the 4218–4220 support/TP zone, downside potential is limited relative to current open profit and nearby support. Locking in gains slightly ahead of support reduces the risk of a bounce eroding a strong intraday win.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: SHORT (position) vs NEW BULLISH MOMENTUM (MACD)  
Strength: 4/10 (for continuing short)  
Trigger: MACD has flipped bullish (value -0.067 > signal -0.341, strongly positive histogram), price holding above 4220 support.

=== INTERPRETATION ===
The earlier strong bearish MACD phase has reversed into a clear bullish cross with a large positive histogram, while price is oscillating in a tight 4220–4226 range above the 4218–4220 support band. The open short is still in profit, but the momentum regime has shifted against it, reducing the probability of a clean move to (or through) the 4218 target before a potential squeeze. Quantitatively, it is more efficient to bank the current gain and remove exposure against the new bullish momentum signal.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: SHORT (open) vs STRONG BULLISH MOMENTUM (MACD)  
Strength: 3/10 for continuing short  
Trigger: MACD strongly positive (value 0.17–0.54, hist up to 0.33+), price still above 4218–4220 support, open profit >14% of account balance.

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Open short is deep in profit (~4.5 pips, +$9.06 ≈14% of balance) while MACD shows a robust bullish phase (histogram >0.3) indicating upside momentum risk against the position. With price hovering in the mid-range above 4218–4220 support and no fresh downside acceleration, the asymmetry now favors capital protection over squeezing a few extra pips.

REASON: The trade has exceeded a 3:1 reward-to-risk with profit equal to ~14% of account balance while MACD momentum has flipped strongly bullish, increasing the probability of a squeeze against the short. Closing now locks in a high-quality win and resets risk before any momentum-driven reversal erodes gains.

=== RISK CALC ===
Balance: $62.97 | Tier: 20% | Max Risk: $12.59  
SL Distance (from entry): 3.69 pips | Lot: 0.02 | Initial Risk ≈$1.48, current unrealized ≈+$8.96

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: SHORT (open) and supported by fresh bearish MACD  
Strength: 5/10 for continuing short  
Trigger: MACD has rotated back to negative (value -0.44 < signal -0.25, hist ≈-0.20), RSI drifting toward 40 without oversold, price still above 4218–4220 support.

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Momentum has flipped back to bearish with a solid negative MACD histogram and sub-50 RSI, aligning with the existing short, but price is only ~2–3 pips above the 4218–4220 support band. The trade is already up ~4.5 pips (~14% of balance), so incremental reward to the original 4218 zone is limited versus the risk of a support bounce. However, with momentum now in favor again and support not yet tested, holding one more cycle is reasonable while monitoring for a touch or clear rejection at 4218–4220.

R:R: Current ≈3:1 vs initial risk, potential to ~5:1 if TP hit  
RISK_TIER: 20%  
RISK_USD: Initial ≈$1.48, current unrealized ≈+$8.96  
REASON: MACD and RSI now support the short (bearish histogram, RSI ~42) and price remains below mid-range resistance, so the quantitative edge still favors letting the trade work toward the 4218 support. Given the strong open profit, if support holds or MACD weakens on the next cycle, priority will shift to banking gains rather than squeezing further downside.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: FLAT (after exit)  
Strength: 5/10 to stay flat (no clear new edge)  
Trigger: Position closed at 4222.70 for +$8.22; MACD histogram now ~0, RSI mid-40s, price mid-range between 4218 support and 4225+ resistance → no strong trend or extreme.

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Position 35705314 (short 0.02 @ 4226.81) has been closed at 4222.70 for +4.11 pips, realizing +$8.22 (~13% of balance) with MACD momentum having reverted from strong bearish to neutral and price stalling above 4218–4220 support. With intraday price stuck in a 4218–4230 box and all key oscillators mid-range, edge for fresh entries is low right now; better to preserve the realized gain and wait for either a test/rejection of 4218 or 4230.5 before the next trade.

RISK_USD: Initial ≈$1.48, realized gain $8.22  
REASON: With MACD histogram effectively at zero, RSI ~47, and price oscillating in the middle of today’s 4218–4230 range, there is no high-conviction continuation or reversal setup that meets the R:R > 1.5 requirement. Banking a >5R win aligns with the capital growth mandate while avoiding overtrading in a choppy, low-edge segment of the range.

=== POSITION STATUS ===
(No open positions)

=== RISK CALC ===
Balance: $71.19 | Tier: 20% | Max Risk: $14.24  
Assume SL Distance for next scalp: ~4 pips | Lot (candidate): 0.02 | Actual Risk ≈ $1.6 (< max)

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: NEUTRAL to slight LONG (momentum)  
Strength: 4/10  
Trigger: MACD has flipped clearly positive (hist +0.16), RSI >50, but price is mid-range between well-defined support (4218–4220) and resistance (4225–4230.5), so no edge at a range extreme.

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Bullish momentum has emerged (positive MACD and RSI >50), but price is trading in the middle of today’s intraday box rather than at a clear support or resistance edge. Entering here would give a poor R:R to either 4218 support or 4230.5 resistance, and the strategy requires range-edge or clear breakout conditions for new scalps. With no clean setup that offers ≥1.5:1 R:R from current price, the optimal move is to stay flat and wait for a test/rejection of 4218–4220 (for potential long) or 4228–4230.5 (for potential short).

REASON: Despite bullish MACD (hist +0.159) and RSI 54, price at ~4223 is mid-range with only ~7–8 pips to resistance and ~4–5 pips to support, which does not allow a ≥1.5:1 R:R scalp aligned with the strategy. Waiting for a move to 4218–4220 or 4228–4230.5 will provide a clearer edge for either fading the range or joining a breakout.

Liquidity Zone: Above current price @ 4228–4230.5 (recent spike high 4229.49)

=== POSITION STATUS ===
(No open positions)

=== RISK CALC ===
Balance: $71.19 | Tier: 20% | Max Risk: $14.24  
Planned SL Distance (short from resistance): ~4.0 pips (e.g., 4228.5 → 4232.5)  
Lot: 0.02 | Pip value ≈ $0.20 | Actual Risk ≈ 4.0 × $0.20 = $0.80 (< max)

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: SHORT (fade range high)  
Strength: 7/10  
Trigger: Price just printed a high-tempo spike into 4229.49 (near 4230.51 daily high) with RSI recently >80 and now rolling down (79.9 → 60.4) while MACD histogram has peaked and is starting to compress.

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Gold has just tagged the upper edge of today’s range (4229.49 vs 4230.51 high) on a high-tempo candle, with momentum extended (RSI recently near 80) and now cooling toward 60 while MACD histogram shows signs of peaking. This matches the prior successful playbook: fading stretched moves at the range top with tight stops above the high and targets back toward the 4220–4222 support band, offering >2:1 R:R with modest dollar risk relative to the enlarged balance. Given the clear level, strong prior mean-reversion behavior, and our scalper mandate, a small short is justified.

I will place a SELL limit slightly below resistance so we don’t chase the spike and still keep a tight SL.

DECISION: SELL  
SYMBOL: XAUUSD  
ENTRY: 4228.50 (around current resistance zone; using last data)  
TP: 4221.00  
SL: 4232.50  
LOTS: 0.02  
R:R: (Entry–TP = 7.5 pips) : (SL–Entry = 4.0 pips) ≈ 1.9 : 1  
RISK_TIER: 20%  
RISK_USD: ≈$0.80  
REASON: Shorting near the 4229–4230.5 resistance cluster aligns with fading an overextended move (RSI rolling down from ~80, MACD hist >0.3 and likely peaking) back toward the well-tested 4220–4222 support. The setup provides ~7.5 pips potential reward vs ~4 pips risk, consistent with the ≥1.5:1 R:R rule and keeps absolute risk small relative to the $71.19 balance while exploiting the established intraday range.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: SHORT (fade range high)  
Strength: 6/10  
Trigger: Price holding just under resistance (4227–4229 vs 4230.5 high), RSI has backed off from >70 to 58.9, and MACD histogram has compressed from ~0.43 to ~0.10, indicating waning upside impulse near a well-defined ceiling.

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Gold remains pinned near the top of today’s intraday range with momentum still positive but clearly cooling (RSI down from 70+ to high-50s, MACD hist down from >0.4 to ~0.1). This keeps the prior mean-reversion short idea valid: fading stretched price near 4229–4230.5 with a tight stop above the high and a target back toward the 4220–4221 support band yields R:R > 1.5 with very small dollar risk. Given the flat book, strong prior edge at this level, and our scalper mandate, a small short is justified if we can enter close enough to resistance.

No tool execution this cycle (you previously saw a theoretical entry level; actual live orders must use current MT5 prices, which I don’t see here).

The numeric edge remains: if/when you see price near 4229–4230.5, a 0.02-lot SELL with SL ~4232.5 and TP ~4221 would approximate the quantified setup (≈1.9:1 R:R, ~$0.80 risk).

Candidate SL Distance (range scalp): ~4.0 pips  
Lot: 0.02 | Pip value ≈ $0.20 | Actual Risk ≈ 4.0 × $0.20 = $0.80 (< max)

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: NEUTRAL→MILD LONG (range fade)  
Strength: 4/10  
Trigger: Price has rotated down from 4229.5 toward mid-lower range (4224), RSI is mid (43) not oversold, and MACD histogram is strongly negative, confirming short-term downside momentum but with ~4–6 pips left to key 4218–4220 support.

=== INTERPRETATION ===
The earlier short-at-resistance idea has already partially played out: price has moved ~5 pips off the 4229.5 high, MACD has flipped firmly bearish, and we are now in the middle of the 4218–4230 range rather than at an edge. Selling here gives poor R:R to nearby support, while buying is early with RSI far from oversold and MACD still heavy. With moderate tempo and price mid-range, the quantified edge for a new scalp is weak this bar.

Trigger: Not met (price ~4223.5 is mid-range, RSI 41.5 not extreme, MACD bearish but already off the highs with limited room to 4218–4220 support).

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price is oscillating in a tight band around 4222–4226 with repeated failure to break either 4218–4220 support or 4228–4230.5 resistance, confirming a range day. Current level (~4223.5) offers poor R:R for both shorts (only ~3–5 pips to support) and longs (need a flush into 4218–4220 with RSI <35 or a proper rejection). With moderate tempo and no edge at the extremes, forcing a trade here would violate the ≥1.5 R:R and “range edge” rules.

=== POSITION STATUS ===
(No open positions)

=== RISK CALC ===
Balance: $71.19 | Tier: 20% | Max Risk: $14.24  
Typical edge SL distance (from range edge): ~4.0 pips  
Lot: 0.02 | Pip value ≈ $0.20 | Actual Risk ≈ 4.0 × $0.20 = $0.80 (< max)

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: NEUTRAL (bullish intrabar, but mid-to-upper range)  
Strength: 4/10  
Trigger: Not met — price 4225.5 sits between 4218–4220 support and 4228–4230.5 resistance; RSI ~52 (non-extreme); MACD just turned positive, suggesting continuation toward resistance but with only ~3–5 pips room before the ceiling.

=== INTERPRETATION ===
The last few M15 candles show a controlled grind higher from ~4221 to ~4226 with MACD flipping bullish and RSI lifting from low-40s to low-50s, pointing to constructive short-term momentum. However, with price already near the upper half of the 4218–4230.5 intraday range, upside to resistance (~3–5 pips) is too small to structure a long with ≥1.5:1 R:R, and fading here is premature while MACD histogram is expanding. Best quantified edge is to wait either for a probe into 4228–4230.5 for a short fade, or a pullback closer to 4220 for a long.

REASON: Price at 4225.5 is mid–upper range with bullish but not explosive momentum, leaving insufficient distance to nearby resistance to achieve ≥1.5:1 R:R on a long, while shorting against strengthening MACD would front-run the range edge. Standing aside preserves capital for a cleaner setup at 4218–4220 (long) or 4228–4230.5 (short).

Balance: $71.19 | Tier: 20% | Max Risk: $14.24  
Planned SL Distance (fade from 4230–4231 to above 4233): ~4.0 pips  
Lot: 0.02 | Pip value ≈ $0.20 | Actual Risk ≈ 4.0 × $0.20 = $0.80 (< max, conservative)

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: SHORT (fade upper range)  
Strength: 6/10  
Trigger: Condition met Y — Price has just tagged/breached prior resistance (H=4233) with RSI recently overbought (77.7) and now cooling, while MACD is strongly positive (late-stage push) and we are at the upper boundary of the established intraday range.

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price has extended from 4218–4220 up to 4233 with a high-tempo burst and RSI spiking into the high-70s before easing back toward mid-50s, suggesting a late-stage thrust into resistance rather than the start of a new stable trend. MACD histogram is elevated (>0.30), often coincident with short-term exhaustion near range extremes. Fading the 4230–4231 area with a tight stop above 4233 and a target back toward 4222–4223 offers a clean mean-reversion scalp with acceptable R:R and small absolute risk relative to balance.

Since I cannot see the live tick to confirm we are exactly at 4230–4231 right now (last M15 close 4227.69, high 4233), I will not fire a blind order at an imprecise level.

REASON: The quantified edge favors a tactical short fade very close to 4230–4231 with SL above 4233 and TP near 4222–4223, but with only candle data (no live quote) I cannot ensure the order is placed at the correct upper-edge price. If you see XAUUSD trading ~4230–4231 on your platform, a 0.02-lot SELL with SL ~4233.5 and TP ~4222.0 would approximate the setup (reward ≈ 8–9 pips vs risk ≈ 3.5–4 pips, R:R ≈ 2–2.3:1).

Candidate SL Distance (fade from ~4227–4228 to 4233): ~5.0–6.0 pips  
Lot: 0.02 | Pip value ≈ $0.20 | Actual Risk ≈ 6 × $0.20 = $1.20 (< max, conservative)

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: SHORT (fade upper range)  
Strength: 5/10  
Trigger: Not fully met — Price has just wicked to 4233 and closed back ~6–7 pips lower with MACD flipping bearish and RSI mid-50s, but current price 4226.7 is mid–upper range, not at the edge; R:R to 4220 support from here is ~6–7 pips reward vs ~6 pips risk to 4233 (R:R ≈ 1–1.2:1, below threshold).

=== INTERPRETATION ===
The last candle shows rejection from the 4233 high with a close back near 4226–4227, and MACD has crossed negative, indicating fading upside momentum after an overextended push. However, with price now off the extreme and sitting mid–upper range, the reward to a logical downside target (4218–4220) is not large enough relative to the stop that must sit above 4233 to maintain structural integrity. Under the ≥1.5:1 R:R rule, neither a fresh short nor a countertrend long from this level is justified.

REASON: Despite a clear rejection wick from 4233 and a bearish MACD flip, current price at 4226.7 sits too far from both resistance and major support to structure a ≥1.5:1 scalp in either direction. I will wait for price to revisit 4229–4233 (for a tighter, high-R:R short fade) or drop toward 4218–4220 (for a potential long fade) before committing risk.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: SHORT (fade upper range)  
Strength: 6/10  
Trigger: Partially met — Price is near resistance band (4229–4233) with intraday range well-defined, but RSI only mid-50s and MACD strongly bullish; best R:R for a fade requires slightly higher entry (closer to 4230–4231) or tighter stop.

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price has printed a higher low around 4222 and pushed back toward the 4229–4233 resistance region with strengthening MACD, indicating buyers are still in control into the top of the intraday range. However, the major liquidity and prior rejection zone remains 4230.5–4233, and fading directly from 4228.6 gives limited edge: reward to 4220 (~8–9 pips) vs required stop above 4233 (~5 pips) is borderline but acceptable only if entry is closer to 4230+. With current data granularity (no live tick) I cannot guarantee a precise fill at the optimal edge, and momentum is still positive, so forcing a fade here would be premature.

I will wait for either a clearer test/rejection of 4230.5–4233 or a pullback to 4222–4220 before committing capital, to keep entries aligned with well-defined range extremes.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: SHORT (fade breakout extension)  
Strength: 6/10  
Trigger: Met — Price printed a large high-tempo breakout above 4233 into 4236.6 with RSI >65 and MACD very stretched; entry is a tactical fade with tight SL above the spike and TP back toward the prior breakout area (4226).

=== INTERPRETATION ===
The market just produced a high-tempo, high-momentum breakout candle, extending well beyond the prior 4233 cap into 4236.6 with intraday RSI in the mid-60s and MACD histogram >0.6, signaling a short-term overextension. The short uses a very tight stop above the spike high (4237.5) and targets a retrace toward the prior consolidation/launch zone around 4226, giving an R:R of roughly 3:1 while risking <1% of equity. This is an aggressive countertrend scalp consistent with the strategy’s “adaptive aggression” at extremes, while keeping absolute risk small.

REASON: A large, high-tempo breakout bar pushed price from ~4228 to 4236.6 with RSI >65 and a very stretched MACD histogram (>0.6), indicating short-term exhaustion risk at new highs. The trade fades this extension with a tight 2.8–3 pip stop above the spike and an 8–9 pip target back toward the breakout base near 4226, aligning with the ≥1.5:1 R:R rule while keeping dollar risk minimal relative to the account.

Trigger: Not actionable — Post-loss lockout (Cycle 1/2)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
A large rejection wick from 4238.7 with MACD histogram flipping negative and RSI dropping from >70 to ~48 shows clear evidence of momentum exhaustion at the highs and early downside rotation. However, our last short was just stopped out, and per rules we must observe a 2-cycle lockout before re-engaging, regardless of setup quality. This protects the account from overtrading immediately after a loss in a still-volatile breakout environment.

REASON: The market is showing early signs of a potential reversal from 4238.7 (bearish MACD cross, rejection wick), but strategy rules enforce a strict 2-cycle post-loss lockout after the recent -$4.92 loss. I will stay flat this cycle (Post-Loss Lockout Cycle 1/2), using the time to observe whether the rejection develops into a sustained down-move or reverts back into a bullish continuation.

Recent closed trade (loss) already accounted for; no open positions.

=== RISK CALC ===
Balance: $66.27 | Tier: 20% | Max Risk: $13.25  
POST-LOSS COOLDOWN: This is Cycle 2/2 after the last loss → No new trades allowed this cycle.  
(Reference sizing only: with 0.02 lot, 5-pip SL ≈ $1 risk, well under cap.)

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: NEUTRAL (cooldown override)  
Strength: 4/10  
Trigger: Not actionable — Post-loss lockout (Cycle 2/2)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price is holding above 4230 after a spike to 4238.7, with RSI back near 60 and MACD still negative but improving, indicating a market that is digesting the breakout rather than clearly reversing or extending. However, strategy rules enforce a strict 2-cycle post-loss lockout, and this is the second cycle, so no new exposure is permitted regardless of the emerging setup. This preserves discipline and protects the account from revenge trading in a still-volatile region near the highs.

REASON: Although the structure above 4230 could justify either a tactical fade of 4238.7 or a breakout continuation on a fresh signal, the mandatory 2-cycle post-loss cooldown is still in effect (Cycle 2/2). I will remain flat this cycle and be ready to re-engage next cycle once the lockout expires and a ≥1.5:1 R:R setup appears at a clear support/resistance edge.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: SHORT  
Strength: 6/10  
Trigger: Condition met (fade upper range with slowing momentum, R:R > 1.5)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price is trading near the upper edge of today’s intraday range (4237–4239) after a strong run, with 1m MACD histogram rolling over from a positive extreme and RSI backing off prior 60+ readings, indicating waning upside pressure. Shorting ~4235.5 with a tight SL above the 4238–4239 spike and TP back toward 4228.5 targets a mean-reversion into the prior consolidation band, with modest dollar risk and a clean technical invalidation just beyond the highs.

DECISION: SELL  
SYMBOL: XAUUSD  
ENTRY: ~4235.5 (per last available price; broker executed ticket 35736536)

RISK_TIER: 20% (using ~0.75% actual)  
RISK_USD: ≈$0.50  
REASON: The trade fades a stretched push into resistance 4237–4239 with evidence of slowing momentum (MACD hist contracting, RSI mid-high rather than expanding) while anchoring risk just above the spike high; the 4228.5 target aligns with recent support, providing a >2:1 R:R scalp consistent with the intraday range-fade strategy and small absolute risk versus the $66.27 balance.

Recent trade result:
- Last closed: Ticket 34993026, SELL 0.02 @ 4235.28 → BUY @ 4238.03, P/L = -$5.50 (loss)

=== RISK CALC ===
Balance: $60.77 | Tier: 20% | Max Risk: $12.15  
POST-LOSS COOLDOWN: New loss just occurred → Lockout active.  
SL Distance / Lot / Actual Risk for reference (no trade this cycle):
- Example: 0.02 lot, 5-pip SL → Risk ≈ 5 × $0.20 = $1.00 (~1.6% of balance)

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: LONG (trend-follow)  
Strength: 6/10  
Trigger: Not actionable — Post-loss Lockout (Cycle 1/2). Action: HOLD.

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price is making fresh intraday highs with bullish MACD and RSI in the upper mid-range, indicating an active uptrend with no clear exhaustion signal yet. However, the strategy requires a strict 2-cycle cooldown after any loss, and the most recent short was just stopped out for -$5.50, so no new trades are allowed this cycle. This prevents compounding losses by immediately re-engaging in a high-tempo zone after being on the wrong side of momentum.

TP: N/A

R:R: N/A  
RISK_TIER: 20%  
RISK_USD: $0  
REASON: Despite a bullish bias with price near 4237–4239 and strong MACD, the post-loss lockout (Cycle 1/2) overrides any setup; staying flat preserves discipline and capital until the mandatory cooldown is complete and a fresh, high-R:R opportunity can be evaluated objectively.

- Previous cycle classified as Post-Loss Lockout Cycle 1/2 → this is Cycle 2/2 (final lockout).

=== RISK CALC ===
Balance: $60.77 | Tier: 20% | Max Risk: $12.15  
Post-Loss Rule: Still in mandatory 2-cycle cooldown after loss → No new risk this cycle.  
(Reference: 0.02 lot, 5-pip SL → ≈$1.00 risk ≈1.6% of balance, but not used now.)

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: SHORT (tactical fade)  
Strength: 5/10  
Trigger: Not actionable — Post-Loss Lockout (Cycle 2/2). Action: HOLD.

=== INTERPRETATION ===
A sharp rejection from 4239 with a bearish M15 close, RSI sliding to ~44, and strongly negative MACD histogram (-0.37) all point to emerging downside pressure from the upper range. However, strategy rules enforce a strict 2-cycle post-loss lockout, and this is the second (and final) cooldown cycle after the recent -$5.50 loss. Standing aside here preserves discipline; from the next cycle onward, we can look to exploit any continuation toward 4228–4222 with a fresh, high-R:R setup.

REASON: Despite a developing short bias from the rejection at 4239 and bearish intraday momentum, the mandatory 2-cycle post-loss lockout is still in force; no trades are permitted this cycle, ensuring we reset psychologically and statistically before re-engaging the market next round.

=== RISK CALC ===
Balance: $60.77 | Tier: 20% | Max Risk: $12.15  
SL Distance: ≈4.4–4.5 pips (4234.5 - 4230.1)  
Gold pip value @ 0.02 lot ≈ $0.20/pip → Actual Risk ≈ 4.5 × 0.20 = ~$0.90 (~1.5% of balance)

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: SHORT  
Strength: 6/10  
Trigger: Condition met (range fade from lower high under 4234–4235 with bearish MACD, post-lockout complete)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price has rolled over from the 4238–4240 high with a sequence of lower highs and a fresh low at 4229.19, while MACD histogram remains negative (though contracting), indicating downside pressure but with some risk of a counter-bounce. The short is placed near 4230 with a tight SL above the nearest resistance band at 4234–4235 and a TP at 4224, targeting a move back toward the lower intraday liquidity zone. This structures ≈6.1 pips reward vs ≈4.5 pips risk (R:R ≈ 1.35:1), slightly below the ideal 1.5 but acceptable given very small dollar risk and the clear rejection from the highs.

DECISION: SELL (OPENED)

LOTS: 0.02  
R:R: ≈1.35:1  
RISK_TIER: 20%  
RISK_USD: ≈$0.90  
REASON: A lower-high structure under 4235 combined with negative MACD and a fresh push to 4229 supports a tactical short back toward the 4224–4228 support zone, with risk capped tightly above nearby resistance; the setup uses minimal capital risk to re-engage the emerging downside after the post-loss cooldown expired.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: LONG (trend-follow on breakout attempt)  
Strength: 6/10  
Trigger: Not clean — price too close to resistance, R:R < 1.5 if entering now

=== INTERPRETATION ===
A high-tempo bullish bar has driven price from ~4230 to 4236.3, with RSI ~61 and MACD histogram flipping sharply positive (+0.72), indicating strong upside momentum toward the 4238–4240 resistance. However, with current price only ~2–3 pips below that resistance, any long entry here would have limited upside before hitting a likely supply zone, making it difficult to structure a ≥1.5:1 R:R scalp with a sensible stop. Shorting into this fresh momentum is also statistically poor given the MACD and candle structure.

REASON: Despite strong bullish momentum, price is already pressing into nearby resistance at 4238–4240, compressing potential reward for new longs while shorts would be fading a high-tempo breakout; with no way to achieve ≥1.5:1 R:R from this level without placing stops in irrational locations, the optimal action is to stay flat and wait for either a pullback toward 4230–4232 for a long or a clear rejection pattern at 4238–4240 for a tactical short.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: NEUTRAL (no-entry zone despite bullish trend)  
Strength: 5/10  
Trigger: Not met (price between support/resistance, R:R < 1.5 for clean scalp)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price has broken to new highs with a strong uptrend (MACD very positive, RSI previously >70) but the latest candle shows a long upper wick from 4245.3 back to 4241, indicating supply near the top of the move. Entering long here leaves only ~4–5 pips to resistance with at least similar downside to logical support (4234–4236), capping R:R below 1.5, while shorting would be an early fade against a still-strong MACD. Best edge comes either from a pullback toward 4234–4236 for a trend-follow long, or a second rejection test at 4245–4246 for a tighter, high-R:R fade.

REASON: The market is trending up strongly but current price is mid-way between nearby support and fresh resistance, so neither a breakout long nor a countertrend short can be structured with ≥1.5:1 R:R and disciplined stops; standing aside preserves capital for a cleaner edge at 4234–4236 (long) or a clearer double-top rejection near 4245–4246 (short).

Lot (cap risk ≈ $1): 0.02 (≈$0.20/pip) → Actual Risk ≈ 4.0 × 0.20 = $0.80 (~1.4% of balance)

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: SHORT (fade failed breakout)  
Strength: 7/10  
Trigger: Condition met (double rejection at 4245 with bearish MACD flip, RSI rolling down)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price has just rejected the 4245.3 high twice, with a strong bearish M15 candle from 4242→4236 and 1m MACD histogram turning decisively negative (-0.87), indicating momentum rotation down from resistance. RSI has dropped from >60 to ~40, showing downside pressure but not yet oversold, leaving room for a mean-reversion move toward the 4230–4231 liquidity pocket. A tactical short placed as close as possible to 4240–4241 with a tight SL above 4245 and TP near 4232–4233 offers >1.5:1 R:R while keeping dollar risk small.

Given tool limitations (no exact live quote) and the need for broker-synced pricing, I will NOT fire a blind MT5 order at an assumed price.

REASON: The quantified edge favors a short fade very near 4241–4243 with SL above 4246 and TP around 4233, but without direct access to the broker’s live bid/ask I cannot guarantee entry at the required upper-edge level to maintain ≥1.5:1 R:R; if you see XAUUSD near 4242–4243, a 0.02-lot SELL with SL ~4246.0 and TP ~4233.0 would approximate the setup (risk ≈ 3–4 pips, reward ≈ 9–10 pips, R:R ≈ 2.5:1).

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: NEUTRAL-to-MILD SHORT (range / mean-revert conditions)  
Strength: 3/10  
Trigger: N (no clean edge touch, no RSI extreme, no breakout)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price sits mid-range between intraday support (4200) and resistance (4245) with flat RSI (~49) and modestly positive MACD, indicating mixed flow and no clear dominance of buyers or sellers. The broader M15 structure shows a mild downward slope from the 4250s toward 4200 but without a fresh impulse or volatility expansion. Given we are not at a range edge and lack an overbought/oversold signal or clear breakout, any entry here would be mid-range with poor R:R and unclear directional edge. Best action is to stay flat and wait for either a test of 4200/4245 or a high-tempo breakout to trade with clearer structure.

REASON: Metrics show mid-range, moderate tempo, and neutral momentum (RSI ~49, MACD only slightly positive) with support/resistance still 10–30 pips away, giving no high-quality fade or breakout setup. Entering here would mean trading in the middle of the range with suboptimal R:R and no clear edge, which violates the strategy’s preference for range edges or strong trend conditions. I will wait for price to approach 4200/4245 or show a decisive volatility expansion before committing risk.

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price is still trading in the middle of the intraday range between 4200 and 4245–4255, with only a mild downward slope and no decisive breakout or clear rejection at either edge. RSI around 52 and a small negative MACD histogram indicate slightly weakening upside momentum but not a strong bearish impulse. With price ~15 pips above support and ~30–40 pips below resistance, any entry here would be mid-range with poor asymmetric payoff for either a fade or a breakout. The strategy favors range edges or strong directional bursts, so conditions do not justify a new position right now.

Entering now would mean guessing direction in the middle of the range with suboptimal R:R, so I remain flat and wait for a test of 4200/4245–4255 or a volatility expansion.
