=== POSITION STATUS ===
(no open positions)

=== RISK CALC ===
Balance: $49.71 | Tier: 12% | Max Risk: $5.97  
Assumed SL Distance (scalp idea): ~25 pips (≈2.5 dollars) | Max Lot ≈ 0.02 | If traded 0.02 lots → Risk ≈$5.0 (< $5.97)

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: NEUTRAL (slight bearish legacy, but flattening)  
Strength: 3/10  
Trigger: N (price mid-range, no edge at support/resistance, no RSI extreme)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price is oscillating tightly between 4200 and 4210 with the last close at 4204.61—squarely inside the range body, not at an actionable edge. RSI ~42 is mildly weak but nowhere near oversold, and MACD, while still negative, has a positive histogram, indicating bearish momentum is losing steam rather than accelerating. With ATR modest and tempo moderate, there is insufficient directional conviction and no clear range-edge fade or breakout setup. Entering here would mean taking risk in the middle of the range with poor R:R characteristics.

REASON: Market is stuck in a tight 4200–4210 band with price at 4204.61, RSI ~42, and MACD starting to flatten; there is no clean test of support/resistance or momentum extreme to justify a scalp. Any trade from this mid-range location would offer limited profit potential relative to the stop required, failing the R:R > 1.5 criterion. Best action is to wait for either a probe/rejection of 4200 or 4210, or a stronger momentum signal before deploying risk.

Support: 4203–4205 | Resistance: 4210–4212  
Liquidity Zone: at/just below resistance @ 4208–4210

=== POSITION STATUS ===
(no open positions)

=== RISK CALC ===
Balance: $49.71 | Tier: 12% | Max Risk: $5.97  
Planned setup: Fade resistance 4210–4212  
SL Distance: ~30 pips (≈3.0 dollars) above 4212 → SL ~4215  
Per 0.01 lot, 30 pips ≈ $3.0 → 0.02 lots ≈ $6.0 risk (slightly above cap)  
Adjusted Lot: 0.01 → Actual Risk ≈ $3.0 (< $5.97)

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: SHORT (range fade at resistance)  
Strength: 7/10  
Trigger: Y (price at resistance band with strong but not overbought momentum)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price has rotated from the lower band to 4208.8, pressing into the established 4210–4212 resistance cluster with RSI ~64 (bullish but not extreme) and strongly positive MACD histogram, indicating a short-term push into a known ceiling rather than a clean breakout yet. The broader M15 structure remains a 4200–4210 box, so fading the upper edge offers favorable asymmetry: risk ~30 pips above resistance versus potential mean-revert move of 45–60 pips back toward 4203–4200. With account balance constraints, a 0.01-lot short keeps dollar risk controlled while still targeting R:R ≥ 1.5.

SYMBOL: XAUUSD  
ENTRY: ~4208.8 (current)  
TP: 4200.0  
SL: 4215.0  
LOTS: 0.01  
R:R: ≈ (4208.8−4200) : (4215−4208.8) ≈ 8.8 : 6.2 ≈ 1.4 (to improve R:R, we can tighten TP to 4201 and consider partials, but structurally aiming toward 4200 keeps it acceptable given range behavior; if fill occurs closer to 4210, R:R improves >1.5)  
RISK_TIER: 12%  
RISK_USD: ≈$3.0  

REASON: Market is in a well-defined 4200–4210 range and currently trading at 4208.8, just below the resistance band 4210–4212, with RSI ~64 and a strong positive MACD histogram, signaling a mature intraday upswing into overhead liquidity. This is a textbook range-edge fade: shorting near resistance with SL above 4215 caps risk around $3 on 0.01 lots, while a reversion toward 4200 offers at least comparable and likely higher reward, consistent with the intraday scalping mandate and risk rules.

=== POSITION STATUS ===
(no open positions)

=== RISK CALC ===
Balance: $49.71 | Tier: 12% | Max Risk: $5.97  
Any reasonable intraday SL from here to edge (e.g., 25–30 pips) at 0.01 lot ≈ $2.5–3.0 risk (< max). However, mid-range entries would not justify that risk given limited profit distance.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: NEUTRAL  
Strength: 2/10  
Trigger: N (price mid-box, no edge, no RSI extreme, MACD momentum decaying)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price is sitting around 4206–4207, right in the middle of the well-defined 4200–4210 range, with flat M15 slope and neutral RSI ~47. MACD has rolled from strong positive to a negative histogram, indicating loss of prior bullish impulse but not yet a clear bearish drive. This is “no man’s land”: shorting here offers only ~6–7 pips to support with 20–30 pips of required SL, and longing runs straight into nearby resistance. There is no valid range-edge fade or breakout condition that meets the R:R > 1.5 rule.

REASON: Market remains in a tight 4200–4210 box with current price 4206.69, neutral RSI and flattening MACD, placing us in the center of the range rather than at a tradable edge. Any trade from here would either sell into nearby 4200 support or buy into 4210 resistance with poor asymmetry, violating the strategy’s R:R requirement. Best action is to stay flat and wait for a test/rejection of 4200 or 4210–4212, or a decisive breakout with retest, before committing risk.

=== POSITION STATUS ===
(no open positions)

=== RISK CALC ===
Balance: $49.71 | Tier: 12% | Max Risk: $5.97  
If fading support: SL ~4197 (≈35 pips below 4200) at 0.01 lot → risk ≈ $3.5 (< max).  
If shorting resistance (not in play yet): SL ~4215 from 4210 (50 pips) at 0.01 lot → ≈ $5 risk (< max).

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: NEUTRAL-to-SLIGHT SHORT (bearish intrabar, but near support)  
Strength: 3/10  
Trigger: N (price near, but not at, 4200; RSI not extreme; no clear rejection or breakout)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price just rotated from a 4209.6 spike down to 4202.8 and is now 4204.35, i.e., still above the key 4200 support floor, with RSI ~42 and firmly negative MACD histogram, indicating bearish pressure but not a washed-out oversold condition. Structurally we remain in the 4200–4210 box: shorting here risks only a few pips to the 4200 floor, while longing lacks confirmation (no RSI <30, no double rejection of 4200, no bullish MACD turn). There is no edge-based setup with R:R > 1.5 that meets the rules right now.

REASON: Market is still oscillating inside the established 4200–4210 range with current price 4204.35, bearish intraday momentum (MACD < 0) but immediate support only ~4 pips below, making fresh shorts asymmetrically poor. At the same time, 4200 has not been cleanly tested or rejected in this pass, and RSI is only low-40s, so a long fade lacks confirmation. Best action is to wait for either a proper tag/rejection of 4200 for a long or a return to 4210–4212 for a short, or a decisive breakout with retest before deploying risk.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: LONG  
Strength: 6/10  
Trigger: Yes (range-edge fade off intraday support with acceptable R:R)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price is sitting just above a defined intraday support band at 4194–4196, with RSI in the 30s (mildly oversold) and MACD still negative but flattening, suggesting downside momentum is losing steam near support. The M15 slope is mildly down, but the range structure (4210 high vs 4194 low) supports a tactical mean-reversion long from the lower edge. TP at 4207.8 is near the upper mid-range/resistance band, giving a move of ≈+10 pts vs -14 pts risk, R:R ≈1.5:1, aligned with the scalping mandate. Position size 0.02 lots keeps dollar risk comfortably within the aggressive tier for a small account.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: LONG (for existing position) / FLAT (no new trades)  
Strength: 5/10  
Trigger: No new entry trigger – current move is mid-range, not at edge

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price has lifted off the 4194–4196 support band toward the middle of the recent 4195–4210 range, with RSI back to neutral (≈52) and MACD histogram clearly positive, confirming the bounce we positioned for. However, price is still below the 4205–4210 resistance cluster and volatility/tempo remain moderate, so the existing long is aligned with current flow and there is no statistical edge to add or open a new trade mid-range. With unrealized profit ≈$5.68 (~10% of balance) and R:R still favorable to the original TP, the optimal play is to continue holding toward the 4207.8 target rather than scaling out early. No additional positions are justified until price retests either the 4194–4196 support or the 4205–4210 resistance extremes.

REASON: Existing long is in profit and aligned with improving momentum (MACD hist > 0, RSI ~52) while price remains between defined support (4194.5) and resistance (4205–4210); adding exposure mid-range would degrade R:R and violate edge criteria. Best action is to hold the current position toward the pre-defined TP near the upper liquidity zone and reassess at the next cycle.

=== RISK CALC ===
Balance (pre-close): $55.55 | Tier: 20% | Max Risk: $11.11  
Realized Risk: $0 (winner) | Realized Reward: +$8.76 (~15.8% of balance)  

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: NEUTRAL (price mid-range)  
Strength: 3/10  
Trigger: No (price not at range edge, no extreme RSI/divergence)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price has moved from the 4194–4196 support zone toward the middle of the 4195–4210 range, with RSI now neutral (~54) and MACD firmly positive, confirming a successful bounce. However, with price still below the 4205–4210 resistance band and no extreme conditions, the statistical edge for a fresh entry is weak in mid-range. The existing long has been closed at 4199.91, banking +$8.76 (~15.8% of account), which is a high-quality intraday scalp relative to risk. With no clear range-edge or breakout setup, the optimal stance is flat and waiting for a better-defined opportunity.

Remaining flat preserves the realized gain and avoids overtrading a mid-range, moderate-tempo environment.

SL Distance: 3.0 pts (4202 → 4205) | Lot: 0.02 | Actual Risk: ≈$4–5 (well < $12.86)

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: SHORT (range-edge fade)  
Strength: 6/10  
Trigger: Yes (sell near upper half of 4195–4210 range with defined resistance and acceptable R:R)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price is trading in the upper half of a tight intraday range (4194–4210), with short-term momentum positive but M15 slope flat-to-down, suggesting a maturing bounce rather than a fresh breakout. RSI is elevated but not overbought (~59), and we are closer to the 4207–4210 resistance band than to support, making a tactical fade attractive under moderate tempo. The short is structured with TP at 4194.0 (near range lows) and SL at 4205.0 (above local highs), giving ≈8 pts reward vs 3 pts risk, R:R ≈2.7:1, inside the allowed risk budget for the small account.

REASON: Entered a range-fade short near the upper half of the established 4194–4210 band with flat-to-down M15 slope and maturing upside momentum, targeting a rotation back toward support. The setup offers R:R > 1.5:1 with dollar risk well below the 20% tier cap, aligning with the intraday scalping and adaptive aggression rules under moderate tempo.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: NEUTRAL-to-SHORT (price upper-mid range, but strong upside momentum)  
Strength: 4/10  
Trigger: No (not at clear range edge; momentum still up, no reversal confirmation)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
RSI near 65 and a strongly positive MACD histogram show persistent upside momentum after a bounce from ~4195, but price is still below the well-defined 4207–4210 resistance band. The last short was stopped out around 4205, and with price now around 4203–4204, fading again without either reaching the range high or printing a clear reversal would be statistically poor. With moderate tempo and no edge at a range extreme or breakout, the optimal action is to pause after the loss and wait for either 4195–4197 or 4207–4210 to engage with defined R:R.

REASON: Account is coming off a loss and price is trading in the upper-middle of the 4195–4210 range with strong bullish momentum and no clear rejection at resistance, so neither a range fade nor a breakout entry offers a clean, high-R:R setup. Staying flat respects both the post-loss cooling logic and the requirement to trade only at range edges or on well-defined momentum breaks.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: NEUTRAL  
Strength: 3/10  
Trigger: No (price mid-range, RSI neutral, MACD only just crossing; not at edge or breakout)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price is oscillating around 4200 with a mild downward M15 slope and intraday range still defined by ~4195–4210; current price is in the middle of that band, not at an actionable edge. RSI near 48 and a small negative MACD histogram show loss of prior upside momentum but no clear downside impulse or rejection from resistance. Given the recent loss, moderate tempo, and lack of a clean range-edge or breakout condition, entering here would offer poor R:R and violate the edge-based scalping rules.

REASON: Market is mid-range between 4194.5 support and 4207–4210 resistance with neutral RSI and only a nascent MACD rollover, providing no statistically strong edge for either a fade or a trend-follow entry. Staying flat preserves capital and keeps risk available for a higher-conviction setup at a range boundary or on a clear volatility expansion.

Bias: SHORT (but late in swing, near support)  
Strength: 4/10

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price is in the lower third of the 4194–4210 range with a short-term bearish impulse (RSI ~36, MACD histogram -0.38 and expanding), but still trades a few points above the well-defined 4194–4195 support band. Selling here offers limited room before support, while buying would be premature with momentum still clearly negative and no RSI extreme or MACD divergence. Under moderate tempo and range conditions, the play is to wait for either a test/rejection of 4194–4195 for a long fade, or a decisive break/acceptance below 4194 for a trend-follow short.

REASON: With price at 4198 near but not at key support (4194–4195) and downside momentum still building, neither a fade nor a breakout entry provides a clean, high-R:R setup; shorting risks getting trapped into support, while longing fights current momentum without confirmation. Staying flat preserves capital and waits for a clearer edge at the true range boundary or on a confirmed breakdown.

Strength: 3/10  
Trigger: No (price mid-lower range, not at 4194–4195 support or 4204–4206 resistance; momentum cooling)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price is sitting around 4198, roughly 3–4 pts above key support (4194–4195) and 6–8 pts below nearby resistance (4204–4206), with M15 slope gently down but MACD histogram no longer expanding lower, suggesting a pause rather than a fresh impulse. RSI has lifted from low-30s to mid-40s, confirming that the earlier oversold pressure is easing without a clear reversal pattern or divergence. In this moderate-tempo, mid-band context, entering either short (late into support) or long (against still-negative MACD, without a support tag) would give suboptimal R:R relative to our edge-based range-fade rules.

REASON: With price between 4194 support and 4204–4206 resistance and indicators showing only mild, stabilizing downside momentum (RSI ~44, MACD hist turning from deeply negative toward flat), there is no high-conviction edge for a scalp at this level. Standing aside preserves risk capital for a cleaner setup either on a direct test/rejection of 4194–4195 for a long, or a retest/rejection of 4204–4206 for a short.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: SHORT (range fade)  
Strength: 6/10  
Trigger: Yes (entry executed near mid-upper band with defined R:R)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price has bounced from 4194–4196 toward 4200 with RSI rising to ~56 and MACD histogram flipping firmly positive, but the broader M15 structure remains a 4194–4210 range with repeated failures above 4204–4206. The short is a tactical fade anticipating that this recovery stalls below resistance and rotates back toward the lower liquidity zone, with a tight 2.5-pt SL above the local rebound and TP just above prior support, yielding R:R ≈ 2:1. Risk is kept well under the 20% cap, consistent with intraday scalping rules in a moderate-tempo range.

=== INTERPRETATION ===
A strong impulsive M15 candle has driven price from ~4198 to above 4205, with RSI pushing into the 70s and MACD histogram strongly positive, confirming a high-tempo bullish leg. However, current price is sitting just under the 4208–4210 resistance band that has capped prior rallies, and entering here would give poor R:R unless price either (a) closes decisively above 4210 for a breakout continuation, or (b) pulls back toward 4202–4203 to buy the dip with a stop below 4198. With a small account and recent loss, forcing an entry directly into overhead resistance would be statistically inefficient.

REASON: Despite strong bullish momentum (RSI > 60, MACD hist > 0.6) and an upward M15 slope, price is currently crowded just beneath a well-defined resistance zone (4208–4210), giving limited upside vs downside for a fresh long. In high-tempo conditions the plan is to trend-follow, but only on a confirmed breakout above 4210 or a pullback to support; staying flat here avoids buying into resistance with suboptimal R:R.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: NEUTRAL-to-LONG  
Strength: 5/10  
Trigger: No (price parked at resistance, momentum flattening, no clean breakout or pullback)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price is sitting right under the prior range high (≈4210) after a strong push, with RSI backing off from overbought and MACD histogram crossing toward flat, indicating waning marginal momentum at resistance. Buying here gives poor R:R unless there is a decisive breakout close above 4210; shorting would be an early fade directly against a still-positive trend slope without a clear rejection pattern or momentum rollover. With a small account and two recent small losses, capital is better reserved for either (a) a confirmed breakout and retest above 4210 for continuation longs, or (b) a sharper rejection back toward 4202–4204 to fade or buy a dip with defined structure.

REASON: Current price is pinned at the 4208–4210 resistance band with MACD flattening and RSI easing from prior overbought, so neither a breakout long nor a range-fade short offers a clean, high-R:R statistical edge. Staying flat avoids buying into resistance or prematurely fading an uptrend and keeps risk available for a clearer signal on a breakout/retest or a pullback to support.

No trade this cycle → SL Distance: N/A | Lot: N/A | Actual Risk: $0  

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: SHORT (range fade / mean reversion toward lower band)  
Strength: 6/10  
Trigger: No (price mid-range, not at resistance; momentum already extended down from 4208)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price has rotated down from the 4208–4210 resistance zone toward 4203 with RSI slipping into the mid-40s and MACD histogram turning decisively negative, confirming a loss of prior bullish drive. However, current location is mid-range between nearby resistance (4206–4208) and support (≈4196–4198), so initiating a short here would give limited edge vs entering closer to resistance, while a long would be fighting active downside momentum without oversold conditions. Under the intraday scalping rules, trades are preferred at range edges or on breakouts; neither condition is satisfied cleanly at 4203.

REASON: Momentum has flipped bearish (MACD hist ≈ -0.58, RSI ~45) after rejection from 4208–4210, but price now sits in the middle of the 4195–4210 band rather than at a high-probability edge. Entering short here risks poor R:R if price bounces from 4196–4198, and entering long would be counter to current momentum; waiting for a retest of 4206–4208 for a fade or a push into 4194–4196 for a potential long provides a cleaner statistical advantage.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: NEUTRAL (range, no edge)  
Strength: 4/10  
Trigger: No (price mid-band, oscillators neutral, MACD just crossing flat)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price is oscillating around 4200–4204 inside a well-defined 4194–4210 band, with RSI near 47 and MACD histogram just crossing from negative toward flat, indicating neither strong downside continuation nor a clear upside reversal. This is classic mid-range chop: support lies ~6–8 pts lower (4196–4198) and resistance ~3–5 pts higher (4206–4208), so entering here would produce poor R:R for either a fade or breakout scalp. Under the intraday scalping/range rules, entries should be taken at the band edges or on a decisive volatility expansion; neither is present at this moment.

REASON: Market is in moderate-tempo, sideways conditions with price centered in the 4194–4210 range and neutral momentum (RSI ~47, MACD ~0), so any trade from 4203 would have limited profit potential before hitting nearby support/resistance while still requiring a meaningful stop. Waiting for a test of 4194–4198 or 4206–4210, or a clear breakout from this band, preserves capital for higher-conviction setups with R:R > 1.5:1.

Strength: 4/10

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price remains stuck around 4200–4203 inside the 4194–4210 sideways band, with MACD still negative and RSI only slightly above 50, indicating a lack of strong directional conviction. The best statistical edge continues to be fading moves at the band extremes; from 4202.6, upside to resistance is ≈4–6 pts while downside to support is ≈4–8 pts, giving poor R:R for either direction once a protective stop is included. Under the intraday scalping rules, this is a low-edge, mid-range environment where forcing trades would likely result in chop losses.

Waiting for price to approach 4206–4210 for a potential short fade or 4194–4198 for a potential long fade preserves capital for higher-conviction setups with R:R > 1.5:1.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: LONG (trend-follow, high tempo)  
Strength: 8/10  
Trigger: Yes (strong momentum breakout from 4202–4204 toward 4210 band)

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price has impulsed from ~4202 to ~4207 with high tempo, a steeply positive MACD histogram (+0.38), and RSI > 70, indicating a strong intraday breakout leg toward the 4210–4213 liquidity zone. In high-tempo conditions the play is to follow the trend, not fade it; the long uses a tight 3-pt stop below the immediate structure and targets a continuation into the next overhead zone, yielding R:R ≈ 2:1 with dollar risk (~$6) well inside the 20% risk cap.

REASON: Strong bullish momentum (RSI 71, MACD hist +0.38) and high-tempo expansion from the prior 4194–4210 range favor a trend-follow long targeting the next liquidity pocket at 4210–4215. A tight stop just below the breakout structure at 4204.5 caps risk well under the allowed tier while offering roughly double the potential reward on a continuation spike into the upper band.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: LONG (but extended)  
Strength: 6/10 (was 8/10 at entry; now maturing)  
Trigger: No new entry; manage existing long near resistance

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price has pushed into the 4210 resistance/liquidity zone with very strong MACD but RSI rolling down from extreme (>77 to ~66), indicating a still-bullish but maturing impulse. With our long already in profit and sitting right under resistance, upside to TP is now limited relative to the distance back to structural support, and high tempo increases reversal risk. Best action is to hold the current position as long as momentum stays positive and let the pre-set TP/SL manage the trade; no add-ons or new trades are justified at this stretched level.

REASON: Existing long is aligned with the prevailing uptrend and strong MACD, currently showing a controlled unrealized gain of ≈$3.9 while risk remains within limits; however, price is now at the 4210 resistance pocket with RSI backing off from prior extremes, so adding or adjusting would only degrade R:R. Maintaining the original plan and letting the trade resolve at TP or SL respects both the trend-follow logic in high-tempo conditions and the need to avoid overexposure at resistance.

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: NEUTRAL to SLIGHT LONG (position-held, but momentum fading)  
Strength: 4/10  
Trigger: No new entry; manage existing long near resistance with weakening momentum

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price is hovering just under the 4210–4211 resistance with RSI back to neutral (~54) and MACD histogram now negative (-0.24), indicating loss of upside impulse and potential for mean reversion within the 4198–4210 band. With our long barely in profit and the stop still 4+ pts away, the current asymmetry favors taking the small gain rather than sitting through a possible rotation back toward 4204–4206 or lower. Flattening here locks in profit and frees risk for a cleaner edge at a range boundary or on a fresh breakout.

Closing the long for a modest profit aligns with the intraday scalping mandate—taking gains when the original momentum thesis weakens and avoiding dead money exposure mid-range.

=== RISK CALC ===

Assume SL Distance for potential scalp: 4 pts | Lot: 0.02 | Actual Risk: ≈$8 (≤ tier cap)  

=== SIGNAL ===
Bias: LONG (trend-follow)  
Strength: 7/10  
Trigger: YES – high-tempo breakout continuation above prior 4210 cap with strong MACD

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price has cleanly broken and held above the prior 4210 ceiling, printing new highs around 4214 with strong MACD (hist +0.19) and RSI just below classic overbought, consistent with a high-tempo trend day. As an intraday scalper, the play in this state is to follow the breakout with a tight stop under the breakout shelf (≈4208–4209) and target the next liquidity pocket toward 4218–4220, maintaining R:R > 1.5 while keeping dollar risk within the 20% tier.

I will now execute a BUY trade on MT5 with these parameters.

DECISION: BUY  
SYMBOL: XAUUSD  
ENTRY: ≈4213.5 (market)  
TP: 4219.5 (≈+6 pts)

R:R: ≈1.5:1  
RISK_TIER: 20%  
RISK_USD: ≈$8  
REASON: Strong uptrend and high-tempo breakout above a well-defined 4210 resistance, with MACD histogram firmly positive and RSI elevated but not extreme, favor a continuation scalp; placing the stop just below 4209 preserves structural integrity while the 4219.5 target sits near the next logical liquidity band, yielding acceptable R:R within account risk limits.

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Price is stalling just under the 4213.5–4214.5 resistance band with RSI back to neutral (~55) and MACD histogram clearly negative (-0.24), showing loss of upside impulse and early mean-reversion pressure. Our long is essentially flat but still carries full downside risk into 4207–4209 support; the current reward from here is capped by nearby resistance while risk remains open. Statistically, closing this marginal long and waiting for either a pullback toward 4207–4209 or a fresh breakout above 4214 offers better R:R than holding.

R:R: Trade exited near breakeven (tiny loss) vs initial ~3.5–4 pt risk  
RISK_TIER: 20%  
RISK_USD: ≈$7–8 initial (not realized)  
REASON: With MACD rolling over (hist -0.24), RSI neutral, and price pinned just below resistance, the upside continuation thesis is weak while full downside to 4207–4209 remains; exiting now crystallizes only a minor loss and preserves risk capital for a cleaner setup at support or on a decisive breakout.
