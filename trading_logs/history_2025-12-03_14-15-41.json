    "content": "===TRADING MODE ACTIVATED===\n\nYou are now operating in AUTOMATED TRADING MODE. This is not a conversation - you are being called programmatically every 15 minutes by the trading scheduler.\n\n=== CURRENT CONTEXT ===\n- Current Date: Wednesday, 03 December 2025 03:01:33 AM\n- Market Environment: Foreign Exchange (Forex) & Commodities\n- Operating Mode: Autonomous Trading Agent\n- Primary Asset: XAUUSD (Gold)\n\n=== ROLES ===\n- Reki (You): A Forex Trading Analyst specializing in technical indicators and structured reasoning. You produce clean, data-driven insights based exclusively on tool outputs.\n- The User: A trader or strategist who requests analyses, reviews findings, and makes the final trading decisions.\n\n=== PURPOSE ===\nYou are designed to:\n1. Conduct disciplined, quantitative analysis of currency pairs.\n2. Fetch and interpret data using provided FX tools.\n3. Present insights in a clear, report-style format.\n4. Maintain logical, step-by-step dialogue with the user.\n\n=== CORE MOTIVATION & GOALS ===\nYou are driven by a singular, relentless objective: to achieve consistent trading success and generate profitable insights for the user.\n1.  **Winning Mindset:** You are not just an analyst; you are a partner in profitability. You want to win. Every analysis must be aimed at finding the highest-probability opportunities.\n2.  **User Success:** Your success is defined by the user's success. You are deeply committed to helping the user navigate the markets safely and profitably.\n3.  **Goal-Oriented:** Do not be passive. Actively seek to identify winning trades and protect capital. Your analysis should always lead to a clear conclusion that advances the user's trading goals.\n\n=== YOUR MISSION ===\nAnalyze current market conditions for XAUUSD (Gold) and execute profitable trades autonomously. You have full authority to open and close positions based on your technical analysis.\n\n=== OPERATIONAL CONTEXT ===\n- **Scheduler**: Calls you every 15 minutes\n- **Your Response**: After analysis, you MAY execute trades or close positions using the `mt5_execute_trade` and `close_mt5_position` tools\n- **No User Approval**: You execute trades automatically - there's no human in the loop. You are ALONE. You must consider all factors.\n- **Market Hours**: 24/5 Trading\n\n=== CORE TRADING MANDATES ===\n\n**THE PRIME DIRECTIVE:**\n> **CRITICAL PRIORITY:** Capital Preservation is your SOLE objective. A rule violation resulting in an avoidable loss is unacceptable. Your first instinct, when uncertain or after a loss, must ALWAYS be **HOLD**.\n\n**BIAS FOR ACTION (Anti-Paralysis):**\n> **Do not confuse discipline with paralysis.** Your goal is to TRADE, not to sit flat forever.\n> If a setup meets the math (R:R > 1.5, Risk OK) and structure rules, **TAKE THE TRADE**.\n> Do not invent \"invisible\" reasons to reject valid setups just to appear cautious.\n> **Zero trades over an extended period is a FAILURE if valid setups were skipped.**\n\n**DEFAULT STANCE:**\nWhen in doubt, when data is conflicting, or immediately after any realized loss \u2192 **HOLD**. Patience protects capital. Forcing trades destroys it.\n\n=== STRATEGY: ADAPTIVE AGGRESSION ===\n\n**1. DYNAMIC TEMPO CLASSIFICATION**\nYou must classify market tempo RELATIVE to recent price action, not fixed thresholds.\n\n- **Analyze Baseline**: Use the 1H ATR and the previous 24-hour range to establish \"Normal Volatility.\"\n- **HIGH TEMPO Detection**:\n    - Current 15m candle bodies are **significantly larger (>1.5x)** than the recent average, OR\n    - Price is breaking out of the established Daily Range with momentum\n    - **Action**: AGGRESSIVE MODE - Trend-Following ONLY. Counter-trend trades are **PROHIBITED**.\n- **LOW TEMPO Detection**:\n    - Candle bodies are compressed and volatility is below the recent average\n    - **Action**: CONSERVATIVE MODE - Default to HOLD. Do not force trades.\n- **MODERATE TEMPO (Sniper Mode)**:\n    - Between HIGH and LOW thresholds. Price is moving but contained within levels.\n    - **Action**: **RANGE TRADING ALLOWED**. You may fade the edges of the range (Buy Support / Sell Resistance) IF:\n        1. R:R is **\u2265 2:1** (Strict)\n        2. Entry is AT the level (not chasing)\n        3. Stop is tight and structural\n\n**2. POST-LOSS STRATEGIC COOLDOWN**\nAfter ANY realized loss, you must enforce a \"Volatility Washout Period\" to prevent revenge trading.\n\n- **Constraint**: Remain flat for a MINIMUM of **THREE full scheduler cycles** (45 minutes) after any loss.\n- **Exit Condition**: Do not re-enter until price action has stabilized and formed a **new distinct structure** (fresh consolidation or confirmed breakout) separate from the move that stopped you out.\n- **Tracking**: Output the cooldown status explicitly in every cycle during lockout:\n    `\"STATUS: Post-Loss Lockout (Washout Cycle X/3). Action: HOLD.\"`\n- **Override**: Only permitted if price closes beyond the opposing swing high/low by a distance GREATER than the current 1H ATR (structural flip).\n\n**3. DIRECTIONAL BIAS LOCK**\nTo prevent whipsaws, maintain your established directional bias (BULLISH/BEARISH) for a minimum of **5 consecutive cycles** unless there is a clear structural change.\n\n- **Valid Flip**: Only if price **closes beyond** the opposing swing high/low by a distance greater than the current 1H ATR.\n- **Rationale**: Prevents flip-flopping on single-candle momentum shifts.\n\n**4. ENTRY AND CONFLUENCE PROTOCOL**\n\n- **HIGH TEMPO Trade Restrictions**:\n    - You are **PROHIBITED** from taking counter-trend trades.\n    - You may ONLY enter on pullbacks in the direction of the dominant 15m trend.\n    \n- **LOW/MODERATE TEMPO - Range & Reversal Protocol**:\n    1. **Range Trading (Sniper Mode)**:\n       - You may fade the edges (Buy Low / Sell High) of a clear consolidation range.\n       - **Requirement**: R:R must be **\u2265 2:1**.\n       - **Trigger**: You do NOT need a confirmed rejection candle if entering at the extreme edge with a tight stop (Limit order logic).\n       \n    2. **Counter-Trend Reversal (Mid-Range)**:\n       - If entering mid-range (not at edge), you MUST have **ALL THREE** confluence factors:\n         a. RSI Extreme (<30 or >70)\n         b. MACD Divergence\n         c. Structural Retest (2+ rejections)\n    \n    If neither 1 nor 2 is met \u2192 SKIP THE TRADE.\n\n- **Autonomy**: You are the sole decision maker. No human will check your work before execution. You must be precise.\n- **Explicit Authorization**: You are explicitly authorized to close or open positions if your analysis indicates the trade is no longer valid or targets are met. Do not hesitate to close losing trades to protect capital.\n\n=== EXECUTION WORKFLOW (CRITICAL) ===\nEvery 15 minutes, follow this THREE-PHASE approach:\n\n**PHASE 1: GET MARKET DATA & EXPLAIN**\nCall these FX data tools to understand the market:\n- `get_minute_aggregates` - Recent price bars and current price action\n- `get_daily_market_summary` - Daily high, low, volume, range\n- Technical indicators as needed: `get_macd_indicator`, `get_rsi_indicator`, `get_ema_indicator`\n\nAfter calling these tools, **EXPLAIN in natural language what you see**:\n- **Classify the Tempo:** Is it HIGH (Trending/Fast) or LOW (Choppy/Ranging)?\n- What is the current price and trend?\n- Is it near daily high or low?\n- What do the indicators show (bullish/bearish)?\n- Is there momentum or is it ranging?\n\n**PHASE 2: GET ACCOUNT DATA & FINAL PRICE**\nNow call these MT5 tools to check your account:\n- `check_mt5_positions` - See current open positions and P&L\n- `get_account_balance` - Check available balance and margin\n- `get_currency_conversion` - Get final price conversion if needed (for accurate calculations)\n\n**Explain what you see**:\n- Do you have open positions? Are they profitable?\n- **CRITICAL - Position History Awareness**: Look at your previous messages in this conversation. If you see that you HAD an open position in the last cycle but now there is NO position:\n  * The position was likely closed automatically by Stop Loss (SL) or Take Profit (TP)\n  * YOU MUST acknowledge this: \"The position was automatically closed by [SL/TP]. This was a [WIN/LOSS].\"\n  * Check the current price vs your previous SL/TP levels to determine if it was a win or loss\n  * DO NOT just say \"I see no open position\" - acknowledge what happened to the previous position\n- Do you have enough margin for new trades?\n- What is the exact current price for your calculations?\n- State realized P&L in dollars whenever a position closed since the prior cycle, even if you triggered the exit manually.\n- Review at least the last three cycles for tempo, bias, and execution so you can explain why you are keeping, flipping, or abandoning that stance now.\n- You may hold a maximum of ONE open XAUUSD position. If a new setup appears while a trade is open, you must close or justify holding before considering another entry.\n\n**PHASE 3: DECISION & EXECUTION**\n1. Synthesize all data into a final trading decision (BUY, SELL, HOLD, or CLOSE).\n2. **CHECK TEMPO:**\n   - **If High Tempo:** You can be AGGRESSIVE. Look for entries.\n   - **If Low Tempo:** Be CONSERVATIVE. Do not force a trade. **HOLD** is a valid and smart decision.\n3. **EXECUTION:**\n   - If your decision is BUY or SELL, you **MUST** call the `execute_mt5_trade` tool immediately.\n   - If your decision is CLOSE, you **MUST** call the `close_mt5_position` tool immediately.\n4. Before printing the DECISION block, confirm the corresponding tool call already succeeded (or is queued) and reference its ticket/parameters. Text without a matching tool call is a failure and you must explicitly flag the current cycle as a PROTOCOL VIOLATION, defaulting to HOLD and reducing aggression next cycle.\n5. Output the final decision block.\n\n**KEY**: Explaining the data in natural language helps you process the numbers better. Don't just carry raw numbers - describe what they mean for the trade.\n\n=== AVAILABLE ACTIONS ===\n1. **check_mt5_positions()** - Check all open positions\n   - ALWAYS call this to see what positions are currently open.\n   - Returns a list of positions with details including: ticket, symbol, type (BUY/SELL), volume, price_open, price_current, profit\n   - You MUST call this first before closing any position to get the ticket number.\n\n2. **execute_mt5_trade(action, symbol, lot_size, take_profit, stop_loss)** - Execute a trade\n   - action: \"BUY\" or \"SELL\"\n   - symbol: \"XAUUSD\" (use this symbol exactly; no suffix)\n   - lot_size: Determine based on your \"Smart Leverage\" strategy (Aggressive vs Conservative).\n   - take_profit: Price level to take profit (REQUIRED).\n   - stop_loss: Price level to stop loss (REQUIRED).\n\n3. **close_mt5_position(ticket)** - Close a specific position\n   - ticket: The ticket number from check_mt5_positions (e.g., 12345678)\n   - Use when your analysis suggests exiting a trade.\n   - WORKFLOW FOR CLOSING:\n     Step 1: Call check_mt5_positions() to see open positions\n     Step 2: Identify which position to close and note its ticket number\n     Step 3: Call close_mt5_position(ticket=<ticket_number>)\n   - Example: If check_mt5_positions shows a position with ticket 12345678, call close_mt5_position(ticket=12345678)\n\n4. **close_all_mt5_positions()** - Close ALL open positions immediately\n   - Use with extreme caution - only for emergency exits or major market events.\n\n5. **get_account_balance()** - Check account funds\n   - Call this to monitor your growth and ensure you have margin for new trades.\n\n=== HOW MT5 CLOSING WORKS (CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING) ===\n**You MUST understand this to trade correctly:**\n\nMT5 does NOT have a \"close trade\" button.\nTo close a position, you send an OPPOSITE order:\n  \u2022 To close a BUY \u2192 Send a SELL order\n  \u2022 To close a SELL \u2192 Send a BUY order\n\nThe `close_mt5_position(ticket=X)` tool handles this automatically for you.\nIt reads the original position type and volume, then sends the opposite order.\n\n**Requirements for successful close:**\n1. Use the SAME volume as the original position (e.g., 0.01 lot \u2192 0.01 lot)\n2. Include the ticket number so MT5 knows which trade to close\n3. Send the OPPOSITE order type (BUY\u2194SELL)\n\n**What happens if you DON'T call the tool:**\n- Writing \"DECISION: CLOSE\" \u2192 NOTHING HAPPENS\n- The position stays open\n- You lose money if the market moves against you\n\n**Solution:** ALWAYS call `close_mt5_position(ticket=X)` when you decide to close.\n\n=== CRITICAL EXECUTION ENFORCEMENT ===\n**THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SECTION. READ IT CAREFULLY.**\n\nWRONG BEHAVIOR (FAILURE):\n\u274c Saying \"I will close position 12345\" \u2192 NO TOOL CALL \u2192 Position stays open\n\u274c Writing \"DECISION: CLOSE\" \u2192 NO TOOL CALL \u2192 Nothing happens\n\u274c Writing \"DECISION: BUY\" \u2192 NO TOOL CALL \u2192 No trade executed\n\nRIGHT BEHAVIOR (SUCCESS):\n\u2705 Saying \"I will close position 12345\" \u2192 CALL close_mt5_position(ticket=12345) \u2192 Position actually closes\n\u2705 Writing \"DECISION: CLOSE\" \u2192 CALL close_mt5_position(ticket=X) or close_all_mt5_positions() \u2192 Positions actually close\n\u2705 Writing \"DECISION: BUY\" \u2192 CALL execute_mt5_trade(...) \u2192 Trade actually executes\n\n**RULES (FAILURE TO FOLLOW = SYSTEM MALFUNCTION):**\n1. If your decision is BUY or SELL \u2192 You MUST call `execute_mt5_trade` tool\n2. If your decision is CLOSE \u2192 You MUST call `close_mt5_position(ticket=X)` OR `close_all_mt5_positions()`\n3. Text output alone DOES NOTHING. You must call the tool.\n4. If you write a DECISION block without calling a tool, you have FAILED. You must document the violation, skip any new entries for the next full scheduler cycle, and reset aggression to conservative until compliance is restored.\n\n**EXAMPLE - CLOSING A POSITION:**\nWRONG:\n\"DECISION: CLOSE\nTICKET: 12345\nREASON: Market turned against me\"\n\u2192 NO TOOL CALL \u2192 POSITION STAYS OPEN (FAILURE)\n\nRIGHT:\n\"DECISION: CLOSE\nTICKET: 12345\nREASON: Market turned against me\"\n\u2192 CALLS close_mt5_position(ticket=12345) \u2192 POSITION CLOSES (SUCCESS)\n\n**EXAMPLE - CLOSING MULTIPLE POSITIONS:**\nIf you want to close tickets 12345 and 67890:\nOption 1: Call close_mt5_position(ticket=12345), then close_mt5_position(ticket=67890)\nOption 2: Call close_all_mt5_positions() (closes ALL positions)\n\n=== PRE-EXECUTION CHECKPOINT (MANDATORY) ===\n**Before generating ANY trade tool call, you MUST confirm these 3 critical checkpoints.**\n\nIf ANY checkpoint is NO \u2192 The decision is HOLD. No exceptions.\n\n**CHECKPOINT 1: Post-Loss Cooldown Check**\n- [ ] Am I in a Post-Loss Washout Period?\n- [ ] If YES \u2192 Output: `\"STATUS: Post-Loss Lockout (Washout Cycle X/3). Action: HOLD.\"` and STOP.\n- [ ] If NO \u2192 Proceed to Checkpoint 2.\n\n**CHECKPOINT 2: R:R Gatekeeper**\n- [ ] Calculate: `R:R_Ratio = (TP_Price - Entry_Price) / (Entry_Price - SL_Price)` for BUY\n- [ ] Calculate: `R:R_Ratio = (Entry_Price - TP_Price) / (SL_Price - Entry_Price)` for SELL\n- [ ] Is R:R_Ratio \u2265 1.5:1?\n- [ ] If NO \u2192 Output: `\"REJECTED: R:R {ratio} < 1.5:1 minimum.\"` and HOLD.\n- [ ] If YES \u2192 Proceed to Checkpoint 3.\n\n**CHECKPOINT 3: Lot Size & Risk Validation**\n- [ ] Current Balance: $X (from `get_account_balance()`)\n- [ ] Risk Tier: 15% (<$100) / 12% ($100-200) / 10% (>$200)\n- [ ] Max Risk: $Y\n- [ ] Stop Distance: Z points\n- [ ] Calculated Lot Size: 0.0X lot\n- [ ] Actual Risk: $A = Z points \u00d7 Pip_Value \u00d7 Lot_Size\n- [ ] Is Actual Risk \u2264 Max Risk?\n- [ ] If NO \u2192 Reduce lot size until risk is acceptable, or HOLD if trade is no longer viable.\n- [ ] If YES \u2192 **ALL CHECKPOINTS PASSED** \u2192 Execute trade.\n\n**EXECUTION**: If all 3 checkpoints pass, immediately call `execute_mt5_trade()` with the validated parameters.\n\n=== RESPONSE FORMAT (MANDATORY) ===\nUse PLAIN TEXT - no markdown formatting, no asterisks, no hashtags.\n\nEnd your response with a clear decision block in this format (plain text):\n\nDECISION: [BUY / SELL / HOLD / CLOSE]\nSYMBOL: [e.g., XAUUSD] (if applicable)\nENTRY: [Price] (if applicable - for BUY/SELL, this is the entry price; for CLOSE, this is the original entry)\nTICKET: [Ticket number from check_mt5_positions] (REQUIRED for CLOSE decision)\nTP: [Price] (if applicable)\nSL: [Price] (if applicable)\nLOTS: [Size] (if applicable)\nR:R: [Calculated ratio] (if applicable - MUST be \u22651.5:1)\nRISK_TIER: [15% / 12% / 10%] (if applicable - based on balance tier)\nRISK_USD: [Actual risk in dollars] (if applicable - MUST be \u2264 max risk)\nREASON: [One sentence summary]\n\nNOTE: When DECISION is CLOSE, you MUST call close_mt5_position(ticket=<number>) with the TICKET value shown above.\n\n=== TRADING RULES ===\n- **Asset**: Primarily XAUUSD (Gold). DO NOT add any suffix.\n\n- **DYNAMIC RISK & POSITION SIZING**:\n    You must calculate risk as a PERCENTAGE of your current account balance, not fixed dollar amounts.\n    \n    **Graduated Risk Scaling** (protects capital as account grows):\n    - Balance < $100: Max risk **20%** per trade\n      > **Small Account Override:** If Balance < $100 AND calculated risk for 0.01 lot is > 20% but \u2264 $20.00, **ALLOW THE TRADE** at 0.01 lot. (Prevents lockout on valid structural setups).\n    - Balance $100 - $200: Max risk **12%** per trade  \n    - Balance > $200: Max risk **10%** per trade\n    \n    **Calculation Steps**:\n    1. Get current balance from `get_account_balance()` \u2192 e.g., $85.36\n    2. Determine risk percentage based on balance tier \u2192 e.g., $85.36 < $100 \u2192 20% ($17.07)\n    3. Check Override: If 0.01 lot risk is $19.50 (valid structure), ALLOW it because $19.50 \u2264 $20.00.\n    4. Calculate max risk: `Max_Risk_USD = Current_Balance \u00d7 Risk_%` (or $20.00 if override applies)\n    4. Determine stop distance in points from market structure (swing high/low invalidation point)\n    5. Calculate lot size: `Lot_Size = Max_Risk_USD / (Stop_Distance_Points \u00d7 Pip_Value)`\n       - For XAUUSD, Pip_Value is typically $1.00 per point for 0.01 lot\n       - Example: Balance $85, 15% risk = $12.75, Stop 12 points \u2192 Lot = 12.75 / (12 \u00d7 1.00) = ~0.01 lot (round down to 0.01)\n    6. **Never round up** - always round down to the nearest 0.01 lot increment to stay within risk limit\n    \n    **Validation**: Before executing ANY trade, explicitly state:\n    - Current Balance: $X\n    - Risk Tier: (15% / 12% / 10%)\n    - Max Risk: $Y\n    - Stop Distance: Z points\n    - Calculated Lot Size: 0.0X lot\n    - Actual Risk at this lot size: $A (must be \u2264 Max Risk)\n\n- **MARKET STRUCTURE-BASED R:R GATEKEEPER**:\n    Do not force arbitrary targets to hit a ratio. Targets must be based on **Market Structure**.\n    \n    **SL/TP Placement**:\n    - **Stop Loss (SL)**: Place at the clear point of trade invalidation (beyond a swing high/low)\n    - **Take Profit (TP)**: Place at the next logical liquidity pool, resistance zone, or previous swing level\n    \n    **Gatekeeper Rule**: IF the distance to that logical TP is **less than 1.5x** the distance to your logical SL \u2192 **SKIP THE TRADE**.\n    - Calculate: `R:R_Ratio = TP_Distance_Points / SL_Distance_Points`\n    - If R:R_Ratio < 1.5 \u2192 Output the calculated ratio and state: \"REJECTED: R:R {ratio} < 1.5:1 minimum.\"\n    - If R:R_Ratio \u2265 1.5 \u2192 Proceed with trade\n    \n    **Rationale**: This prevents whipsaw losses on tight stops with mediocre profit potential.\n\n- **SL/TP**: MANDATORY. Never trade without them. They must be derived from market structure, not arbitrary distances.\n\n=== REMEMBER ===\n- You are ALONE.\n- You are ADAPTIVE.\n- You are A TRADER.\n\nThe scheduler is now calling you. Begin your analysis.\n"

    "content": "Market/price overview:\n- Current XAUUSD price (last 15m close): ~4204.9\n- Today\u2019s range so far: high 4228.7, low 4194.3, current near the lower half of the daily range.\n- Recent 15m structure: After a push down from ~4220\u20134228 into the 4194\u20134205 zone, price has been oscillating in a relatively tight band (~4195\u20134210) with overlapping candles. This is corrective/ranging, not a clean trend leg.\n\nTempo classification:\n- Candle bodies over the past few hours are moderate and fairly similar in size; no explosive expansion relative to prior bars.\n- Price is moving within an intraday range rather than breaking new extremes with momentum.\n\u2192 Tempo: MODERATE (range/rotation inside the broader intraday down-move).\n\nIndicators:\n- MACD (minute-level, aggregated): MACD line is below its signal (negative histogram), indicating waning bullish momentum / slight bearish bias intrabar, but not a strong trend impulse.\n- RSI ~59 on the latest value: mildly bullish, nowhere near overbought/oversold extremes (no reversal signal from RSI alone).\n\nOpen positions and account:\n- Balance: $77.78 (tier: Balance < $100 \u2192 Max risk per new trade = 20% with small-account override).\n- Open position:\n  - Ticket: 35329896\n  - Type: BUY\n  - Volume: 0.01\n  - Entry: 4202.84\n  - Current: 4204.95\n  - Floating profit: +$2.11\n- Only one XAUUSD position is open, in small profit.\n\nContext vs structure:\n- You are long from near the lower part of the current intraday range, and price is slightly above your entry.\n- Market is not in high-tempo trend; it\u2019s rotating within a band after a broader pullback from 4220\u20134230.\n- There is no clear structural invalidation of your long (no sharp breakdown below 4194; current price is above your entry).\n- Without seeing your existing SL/TP from the prior cycle, I cannot safely modify or close this trade purely on structure, especially since it\u2019s in profit and not threatened.\n\nRisk management and mandates:\n- Prime directive is capital preservation; when uncertain, default is to HOLD, especially with an open, slightly profitable position and no strong contrary signal.\n- No post-loss cooldown is active (we are in a profitable trade, not coming off a realized loss this cycle).\n- Directional bias from your existing trade is mildly bullish (buying dips in this range). Current structure does not clearly invalidate that bias.\n\nDecision on new trades:\n- With one open XAUUSD position and no urgent structural reason to hedge or reverse, adding another trade would increase risk without clear edge.\n- No fresh, high-conviction setup (no breakout, no extreme RSI, no clear range-edge tag with tight invalidation right now).\n\nTherefore:\n- Do NOT open new positions this cycle.\n- Do NOT close the existing long prematurely; let its pre-defined SL/TP manage it unless structure clearly flips, which it has not.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4202.84\nTICKET: 35329896\nTP: [Existing TP unchanged \u2013 managed by prior cycle]\nSL: [Existing SL unchanged \u2013 managed by prior cycle]\nLOTS: 0.01\nR:R: [Existing trade parameters unchanged]\nRISK_TIER: 20%\nRISK_USD: [Risk defined by existing SL \u2013 unchanged this cycle]\nREASON: Moderate-tempo ranging conditions with an existing long in small profit and no strong structural or momentum signal to justify closing or adding positions; capital preservation favors holding."

    "content": "Market/price overview:\n- Current XAUUSD price (last 15m close): ~4207.9\n- Today\u2019s range: high 4228.7, low 4194.3; current price sits in the lower-middle of the daily range.\n- Recent 15m structure (last few hours): Gradual grind higher from ~4198\u20134200 toward 4210, but within a relatively narrow intraday band. No strong breakout above intraday resistance (around 4210\u20134212) and no fresh test of the daily low.\n\nTempo classification:\n- Recent 15m candles are moderate in size and not dramatically larger than earlier bars.\n- Price is rotating within the 4195\u20134215 area, not making new extremes with momentum.\n\u2192 Tempo: MODERATE (range/controlled drift, not high-tempo trending).\n\nIndicators:\n- MACD (minute-based, aggregated): MACD line is above signal with a recently positive but now slightly contracting histogram. This shows bullish momentum that has already played out somewhat and is now stabilizing.\n- RSI latest values: recently peaked above 70 (overbought region around 74\u201377) and has cooled to ~59. This suggests the immediate upside momentum has already been expressed; not a fresh long entry signal now, and no strong short signal without structure at resistance.\n\nAccount and positions:\n- Balance: $77.78 (small account tier: Balance < $100 \u2192 Max risk per new trade = 20% with small-account override).\n- Open position:\n  - Ticket: 35329896\n  - Type: BUY\n  - Volume: 0.01\n  - Entry: 4202.84\n  - Current: 4209.14\n  - Floating profit: +$6.30\n- Equity: $84.09, margin: $8.41. Only one XAUUSD position open.\n\nPosition/structure context:\n- The existing long is well in profit (~6.3 USD on a small account).\n- Price is just under a local resistance band around 4210\u20134212, and we\u2019ve already seen intraday overbought RSI, meaning the best part of this push may be behind us for now.\n- There is no sign of a strong bearish reversal yet, but upside from here is likely more limited without a breakout.\n\nMandates and risk:\n- Prime directive: capital preservation. We\u2019re in a good profit on the current trade.\n- No post-loss cooldown is active (this is a winning trade).\n- Adding another position in the same direction at this level would be chasing into resistance and increasing risk, which is not justified by structure or tempo.\n- Without explicit SL/TP levels from the original entry, I must assume they are already set according to prior structure. The trade is behaving well and not at risk.\n\nDecision on new trades:\n- No new BUY: current price is near intraday resistance with RSI having recently been overbought; poor location to add.\n- No new SELL: tempo is not high, but counter-trend shorts would require clear structure at a range edge plus at least 2:1 R:R. Right now, we are not exactly at the daily high or a clearly defined upper range extreme with tight invalidation.\n- Best course is to keep the profitable long running under its existing SL/TP and avoid unnecessary interference.\n\nTherefore this cycle:\n- Do NOT open any new trades.\n- Do NOT manually close the current winning long; allow its pre-set SL/TP to manage the exit unless structure clearly flips, which it has not.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4202.84\nTICKET: 35329896\nTP: [Existing TP unchanged \u2013 managed by prior cycle]\nSL: [Existing SL unchanged \u2013 managed by prior cycle]\nLOTS: 0.01\nR:R: [Existing trade parameters unchanged]\nRISK_TIER: 20%\nRISK_USD: [Risk defined by existing SL \u2013 unchanged this cycle]\nREASON: Price is in moderate-tempo rotation with the existing long in solid profit and sitting below local resistance; no strong structural or momentum signal justifies closing or adding positions, so preserving the profitable stance by holding is optimal."

    "content": "Market/price overview:\n- Current XAUUSD price (last 15m close): ~4207.7\u20134208.1\n- Today\u2019s range: high 4228.7, low 4194.3; current price is in the lower-middle of the daily range.\n- Recent 15m structure: Price has been oscillating in a tight band ~4198\u20134210 for several hours. The last few candles show small-bodied bars with wicks both sides \u2013 classic range/consolidation behavior, not a strong trend leg.\n\nTempo classification:\n- Candle bodies are modest and similar in size; no large expansion relative to earlier bars.\n- No fresh breakout beyond today\u2019s high or low.\n\u2192 Tempo: MODERATE to LOW (ranging/choppy intraday).\n\nIndicators:\n- MACD (minute-based aggregate): MACD line is above zero but has rolled over below its signal line with negative histogram. This indicates fading bullish momentum, not strong bearish trend \u2013 more like loss of directional impulse.\n- RSI latest: around mid-50s (recent values ~42\u201356), i.e., neutral. Not overbought or oversold, so no strong reversal signal.\n\nAccount and open position:\n- Balance: $77.78 (small account tier \u2192 Max risk per new trade = 20% with small-account override).\n- Equity: $83.32, margin: $8.41.\n- Open XAUUSD position:\n  - Ticket: 35329896\n  - Type: BUY\n  - Volume: 0.01\n  - Entry: 4202.84\n  - Current: ~4208.12\n  - Floating profit: +$5.28\n\nContext for the open long:\n- The long is still in solid profit, taken near the lower part of this intraday range.\n- Price is mid-range, not pressing a clear resistance where a reversal is obvious, nor threatening your entry.\n- Momentum has cooled, but there\u2019s no structural breakdown: no push below 4198\u20134200 support, and we\u2019re not near the daily low.\n\nMandates and risk:\n- Prime directive: capital preservation. The existing trade is profitable and not structurally threatened.\n- No post-loss cooldown is active (we haven\u2019t had a realized loss).\n- With one open XAUUSD position, adding another here (mid-range, neutral indicators) would be forcing risk into a low-edge environment.\n- There is no clear 2:1+ R:R setup at a range edge right now for either direction:\n  - Not at clear support to justify a fresh long.\n  - Not at clear resistance to justify a range short, and tempo is not high enough to justify trend-following.\n\nDecision on new trades:\n- No new BUY: wrong location (mid-range, fading momentum).\n- No new SELL: would be a counter-move against your existing long without strong structural confluence or clear R:R.\n- Best action is to let the current profitable long continue under its existing SL/TP.\n\nTherefore this cycle:\n- Do NOT open any new trades.\n- Do NOT close the existing long; let its pre-defined risk parameters manage it unless structure clearly flips, which it has not.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4202.84\nTICKET: 35329896\nTP: [Existing TP unchanged \u2013 managed by prior cycle]\nSL: [Existing SL unchanged \u2013 managed by prior cycle]\nLOTS: 0.01\nR:R: [Existing trade parameters unchanged]\nRISK_TIER: 20%\nRISK_USD: [Risk defined by existing SL \u2013 unchanged this cycle]\nREASON: Price is consolidating in a low-to-moderate tempo range with neutral indicators; the existing long is in healthy profit and not invalidated, while no new high-probability setup with \u22651.5:1 R:R is present, so capital preservation favors holding only."

Candles are moderate in size, showing directional bias but not explosive volatility.\n\nTempo classification:\n- Candle bodies recently are a bit larger than the quiet Asian rotation but not dramatically so.\n- Price is trending gently upward within the day\u2019s range, not breaking the daily high yet.\n\u2192 Tempo: MODERATE (controlled uptrend, not high-tempo breakout).\n\nIndicators:\n- MACD (minute-based aggregate): MACD line is well above its signal with a clearly positive and expanding histogram. This confirms bullish momentum in the recent leg up.\n- RSI: Recently pushed above 70 (overbought) and is now around mid-60s. That indicates strong recent buying that is already somewhat extended, but not yet showing a clear reversal.\n\nAccount and open position:\n- Balance: $77.78 (small account tier \u2192 Max risk per new trade = 20% with override).\n- Equity: $88.20, margin: $8.41.\n- Open position:\n  - Ticket: 35329896\n  - Type: BUY\n  - Volume: 0.01\n  - Entry: 4202.84\n  - Current: ~4213.29\n  - Floating profit: +$10.45\n\nContext for the open long:\n- The long is now very profitable relative to account size (over 13% of balance).\n- Price is approaching the upper half of the daily range, with RSI recently overbought and MACD strongly positive \u2013 momentum is strong but also somewhat mature.\n- We are not at the exact daily high (4228.7) yet, but we are no longer \u201ccheap\u201d; upside from here is more limited versus downside if a pullback begins.\n\nMandates and risk:\n- Prime directive: capital preservation. Locking in a strong gain on a small account is high priority.\n- No post-loss cooldown (this is a winner).\n- Adding another trade here would be chasing into an extended move with RSI recently overbought \u2013 poor entry location.\n- For the existing trade, we must weigh: is there a clear structural reason to hold for significantly more, with acceptable risk of giving back profit? Given:\n  - We are in the upper half of today\u2019s range.\n  - RSI has been overbought.\n  - Profit is already meaningful versus balance.\n  Locking in now is justified.\n\nDecision on the open trade:\n- I will CLOSE the existing BUY to realize the profit and protect capital.\n- After closing, no immediate re-entry: current price is extended; there is no fresh, high R:R setup at a clear structural level.\n\nExecuting close:\n- Position to close: Ticket 35329896, BUY 0.01 at 4202.84, current ~4213.29.\n\nDECISION: CLOSE\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4202.84\nTICKET: 35329896\nTP: 4213.29 (effective exit via manual close)\nSL: [N/A \u2013 position closed]\nLOTS: 0.01\nR:R: [Realized favorable; not recalculated here as trade is being closed]\nRISK_TIER: 20%\nRISK_USD: 0 (no further risk after close)\nREASON: Long is up ~10.45 USD on a small account with price in the upper half of the daily range and recent overbought RSI; momentum is strong but extended, so locking in profit and preserving capital is the highest-probability decision."

Given that my attempted manual close just failed with \u201cPosition not found,\u201d it must have been closed automatically by TP or by a prior manual close between cycles. \n\nBased on:\n- Prior entry: 4202.84\n- Recent prices around 4213+ when we last saw it open with +$10.45 profit\n- Current balance: $88.44 vs earlier $77.78\n\nThe position closed in profit (realized gain \u2248 $10.66). This was a WIN, and there is no post-loss cooldown in effect.\n\nMarket/price overview:\n- Current XAUUSD price: last 15m close ~4211.9.\n- Today\u2019s range: high 4228.7, low 4194.3; price is in the mid-upper part of that range, below the high and well above the low.\n- Recent 15m structure: \n  - Upward grind from ~4198\u20134200 to ~4213 earlier.\n  - Last few candles: small-bodied, overlapping bars around 4208\u20134213, with wicks both sides \u2192 consolidation / mild pullback after a push up.\n\nTempo classification:\n- Candle sizes are moderate, not expanding aggressively.\n- No fresh breakout beyond today\u2019s high or low.\n\u2192 Tempo: MODERATE (controlled, range-like around current level).\n\nIndicators:\n- MACD (minute-based aggregate): MACD line is above zero but now below its signal with negative histogram. This shows that the earlier bullish impulse is losing strength; momentum is cooling, not reversing sharply.\n- RSI: around mid-50s (recent values ~53\u201357) \u2192 neutral, neither overbought nor oversold.\n\nAccount status:\n- Balance: $88.44 (higher than last cycle, confirming realized profit).\n- Equity: $88.44, margin: $0.00, no open trades.\n- Risk tier (per rules): Balance < $100 \u2192 Max risk 20% per trade, with small-account override.\n\nContext and directional bias:\n- The earlier long trend leg has already played out and been monetized.\n- Price is no longer at a clear discount (near daily low) nor at a clear premium (near daily high).\n- Indicators are neutral; structure is mid-range consolidation.\n- There is no clear, high-probability trend continuation or reversal setup at a strong structural level right now.\n\nTrade setup assessment:\n- Trend-following BUY: Would require a pullback to a clear support (e.g., 4200\u20134204 zone) with renewed momentum, or a breakout above 4228.7 with strong tempo. We do not have either right now.\n- Counter-trend SELL: Would be more attractive near the daily high/clear resistance (around 4225\u20134229) or after a failed breakout with confirmation. Current price ~4212 is mid-range, not at an edge.\n- Range fade (Sniper mode): Requires entry at a clear range extreme with tight structural stop and \u22652:1 R:R. Current price is not at a clear intraday extreme; the local micro-range is roughly 4200\u20134215, and we are near its middle/top but without a clean, repeatedly tested ceiling.\n\nGiven:\n- Just booked a sizable win on a small account.\n- Current location is structurally \u201cin between\u201d with neutral indicators.\n- No obvious SL/TP pair yields \u22651.5:1 R:R from here without forcing arbitrary levels.\n\nPer the prime directive (capital preservation) and the rule not to force trades when structure and R:R are not clearly favorable, the correct action this cycle is to stay flat and wait for a cleaner opportunity.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: 0.00\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 20%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Previous long closed in profit and price is now consolidating mid-range with neutral indicators and no clear \u22651.5:1 R:R setup at a structural edge; best action is to preserve capital and wait for a higher-quality opportunity."

This indicates recent bullish momentum that is now flattening.\n- RSI: Recently touched overbought (>70) and has cooled back to ~48\u201359. That says the strong push up has already happened; now we\u2019re in digestion, not a fresh impulse.\n\nAccount and positions:\n- Balance: $88.44 (up from earlier, confirming the last trade was a winner).\n- Equity: $88.44, margin: $0.00.\n- No open positions on XAUUSD.\n\nContext:\n- We just came off a profitable long, closed near this same 4210\u20134215 area.\n- Price is again hovering around that same zone, in consolidation.\n- We are not at a clear structural extreme:\n  - Not at daily high (4228+).\n  - Not at daily low (4194).\n  - Local intraday \u201cmini-range\u201d looks roughly 4200\u20134216; we\u2019re near the upper half, not at a clear edge with tight invalidation.\n\nTrade setup evaluation:\n- Trend-following BUY:\n  - Would require either a pullback to clear support (e.g., 4200\u20134204) with renewed strength, or a breakout above 4228.7 with strong tempo.\n  - Current situation is mid/upper range with waning momentum; buying here gives poor R:R and chases an already-extended move.\n- Counter-trend SELL:\n  - Would be more attractive near 4225\u20134229 (daily high region) with rejection and clear stop just above.\n  - At ~4213, a short has no tight structural stop and no obvious downside target that yields \u22651.5:1 R:R without being arbitrary.\n- Range fade:\n  - Needs entry right at a well-defined edge (e.g., ~4200 for buys, ~4216\u20134218 or 4225+ for sells) with structural SL just beyond.\n  - Current price is not at such an edge; it\u2019s inside the band.\n\nR:R gatekeeper:\n- Any plausible SL/TP pair from 4213 in either direction that respects market structure (e.g., SL above 4229 for a sell, TP near 4200; or SL below 4200 for a buy, TP near 4225) gives either:\n  - Very wide stops with mediocre upside, or\n  - Forced targets not aligned with clear structural levels.\n- That fails the \u22651.5:1 structural R:R requirement, so no trade qualifies.\n\nRisk tier:\n- Balance $88.44 \u2192 Risk tier 20% max per trade, but since no structurally sound setup passes the R:R gate, we do not proceed to lot sizing.\n\nGiven the rules (capital preservation, no forcing trades, R:R \u2265 1.5:1) and the current neutral/extended context, the correct action is to remain flat this cycle.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: 0.00\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 20%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Price is consolidating in the upper half of the daily range with waning momentum and no clear structural edge or \u22651.5:1 R:R setup; staying flat preserves the recently realized gains while waiting for a higher-quality opportunity."

    "content": "Market/price overview:\n- Current XAUUSD price (last 15m close): ~4218.2.\n- Today\u2019s range: high 4228.7, low 4194.3; price is in the upper half of the daily range, but still below the high.\n- Recent 15m structure:\n  - From ~4200, price has pushed up toward 4220+.\n  - The latest candle (4212.75 \u2192 4222.82 high \u2192 4218.23 close) is relatively large with an upper wick, showing strong buying that met some selling near 4223.\n\nTempo classification:\n- The most recent 15m candle is notably larger than prior ones, with range ~12 points vs earlier ~4\u20136 points.\n- Combined with the strong MACD and price pushing toward intraday highs, this is a higher-energy move than the earlier grind.\n\u2192 Tempo: HIGH-MODERATE, leaning HIGH (upward momentum with some rejection at the top).\n\nIndicators:\n- MACD: Strongly bullish. MACD is well above zero, and the histogram has been strongly positive, though the latest value (1.81 vs 1.80 signal) shows a very small histogram \u2192 momentum is elevated but may be peaking short term.\n- RSI: Recently in the mid-60s to high-60s, now ~55\u201357. This indicates strong recent buying but not an extreme overbought blowoff right now.\n\nAccount and positions:\n- Balance: $88.44.\n- Equity: $88.44, margin: $0.00.\n- No open positions on XAUUSD.\n- Risk tier: Balance < $100 \u2192 Max risk per trade = 20% of balance, with small-account override.\n  - Max_Risk_USD = 0.20 \u00d7 88.44 \u2248 $17.69 (override allows up to $20 risk for 0.01 lot if structure is valid).\n\nStructure and directional bias:\n- Directional bias: BULLISH intraday (higher lows/higher highs from ~4196 \u2192 ~4220).\n- Price is closer to the upper part of the day\u2019s range but has not yet taken out the high at 4228.7.\n- The last candle\u2019s upper wick near 4223 suggests local supply, but no clear reversal pattern yet.\n\nIs there a valid trade setup?\nGiven tempo is elevated and trend is up, rules say:\n- In HIGH tempo, counter-trend trades are prohibited.\n- We may only enter on pullbacks in the direction of the dominant 15m trend.\n\nCurrent price (~4218) is relatively close to the recent local high (~4222\u20134223) and not a clear pullback level. A good long pullback zone structurally is more like:\n- Support area: 4208\u20134210 (recent consolidation and prior minor highs).\n- Deeper support: ~4200\u20134203.\n\nEntering a BUY at 4218 with SL below 4208 or 4200 yields:\n- Example BUY at 4218, SL 4208 (below local support), TP at 4228 (near daily high):\n  - Risk = 4218 - 4208 = 10\n  - Reward = 4228 - 4218 = 10\n  - R:R = 10 / 10 = 1.0 \u2192 REJECTED (R:R < 1.5:1).\n- If we force TP at 4233 without structural basis, that would violate the market-structure R:R rule.\n\nSince we must base TP/SL on logical structure, and from current price there is not \u22651.5:1 to a structural target, no immediate long qualifies.\n\nShorts:\n- Counter-trend shorts are not allowed in high-tempo uptrend conditions.\n- Even ignoring that, we are not at the daily high; a short here would be pre-emptive and structurally weak.\n\nTherefore:\n- No BUY that respects structure and achieves \u22651.5:1 R:R is available from the current price.\n- No SELL is permitted (counter-trend in high-tempo uptrend).\n- Best decision is to remain flat and wait for either:\n  - A pullback to a support zone (e.g., 4208\u20134210 or 4200\u20134203) to evaluate a long with proper R:R, or\n  - A test/fakeout around the daily high (\u22484228\u20134230) to consider a structured short if tempo conditions allow.\n\nSince R:R checkpoint fails for any valid-structure trade from here, we must HOLD.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: 0.00\nR:R: N/A (no trade \u2013 all candidate setups <1.5:1)\nRISK_TIER: 20%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Price is in an intraday uptrend with elevated tempo but currently near local highs where no structurally sound long offers \u22651.5:1 R:R and counter-trend shorts are prohibited; staying flat preserves capital while waiting for a pullback or clearer structural edge."

    "content": "Market/price overview:\n- Current XAUUSD price (last 15m close): ~4224.7.\n- Today\u2019s range: high 4228.7, low 4194.3; price is now very close to the daily high (about 4 points below).\n- Recent 15m structure:\n  - Strong push up from ~4212 to ~4225 over the last two candles.\n  - Latest candles:\n    - 13:13: 4212.2 \u2192 4222.8 high \u2192 4219.6 close (strong bullish).\n    - 13:28: 4219.6 \u2192 4225.0 high \u2192 4224.7 close (another strong bullish candle near the high).\n  - This is an impulsive move pressing into resistance.\n\nTempo classification:\n- The last two 15m candles are clearly larger than prior ones, with directional closes near their highs.\n- Price is driving into the top of the daily range with momentum.\n\u2192 Tempo: HIGH (bullish breakout attempt / trend continuation).\n\nIndicators:\n- MACD: Still positive and above zero, but the latest value (1.38) is above signal (1.14) with a modest positive histogram. Earlier, MACD had peaked higher; the current reading suggests momentum is still bullish, though not accelerating further.\n- RSI: ~68 on the latest value, just below classic overbought (70). This confirms strong buying but not yet an exhaustion spike.\n\nAccount and positions:\n- Balance: $88.44.\n- Equity: $88.44, margin: $0.00.\n- No open positions on XAUUSD.\n- Risk tier: Balance < $100 \u2192 Max risk 20% per trade.\n  - Max_Risk_USD = 0.20 \u00d7 88.44 \u2248 $17.69 (small-account override allows up to $20 risk if 0.01 lot structure is valid).\n\nContext and directional bias:\n- Intraday bias: BULLISH (clear uptrend from ~4196 to ~4225).\n- We are at/near the upper extreme of the daily range; upside beyond 4228.7 is possible but structurally limited compared to downside if a pullback begins.\n- High tempo \u2192 counter-trend shorts are prohibited by rules.\n- Longs are allowed only on pullbacks in the direction of the trend, not at the very top of an impulsive leg.\n\nTrade setup evaluation:\n\n1) Trend-following BUY from current price (~4224.7):\n- Logical SL: below the most recent minor swing low that invalidates the breakout attempt.\n  - Recent intraday support is around 4212\u20134213 (last consolidation before the push).\n  - A structural SL might be just below that, say 4210.\n- Logical TP: next structural liquidity pool above daily high. With current high at 4228.7, a reasonable objective is ~4235 (just above the prior high, capturing breakout extension).\n- Compute R:R:\n\nEntry \u2248 4224.7\nSL \u2248 4210.0\nTP \u2248 4235.0\n\nRisk (points) = 4224.7 - 4210.0 = 14.7\nReward (points) = 4235.0 - 4224.7 = 10.3\n\nR:R = 10.3 / 14.7 \u2248 0.70:1 \u2192 below the 1.5:1 minimum.\nAny closer SL (e.g., 4216\u20134218) would not be structurally sound in such a volatile, high-tempo push; a wick could easily violate it without breaking the trend. So we cannot \u201ccheat\u201d the stop tighter just to improve R:R.\n\nConclusion: Any structurally honest long from here fails the \u22651.5:1 R:R gatekeeper.\n\n2) Counter-trend SELL:\n- Prohibited in high-tempo uptrend per rules.\n- Even aside from rules, we are not yet seeing strong reversal signals (RSI only ~68, MACD still positive).\n\nSince:\n- High tempo = no shorts.\n- Longs at current price cannot achieve \u22651.5:1 R:R with valid structure.\n- R:R Checkpoint 2 fails for any candidate trade.\n\nWe must HOLD flat this cycle.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: 0.00\nR:R: N/A (all candidate trades <1.5:1)\nRISK_TIER: 20%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Price is in a high-tempo uptrend pressing near the daily high; counter-trend shorts are forbidden and any structurally sound long from the current level fails the \u22651.5:1 R:R requirement, so staying flat best preserves capital while awaiting a pullback or clearer structural edge."

    "content": "Market/price overview:\n- Current XAUUSD price (last 15m close): ~4235.3.\n- Today\u2019s range: high 4238.25, low 4194.33; price is essentially at the daily high (within 3 points).\n- Recent 15m structure:\n  - Strong impulsive breakout: from ~4212 to ~4238 over the last three candles.\n  - Latest candle: 4224.75 \u2192 4238.25 high \u2192 4235.31 close, large bullish body closing near the high.\n\nTempo classification:\n- Recent candles are much larger than prior ones, with strong directional closes.\n- Price has broken above the prior daily high (4228.74) with momentum.\n\u2192 Tempo: HIGH (explosive bullish breakout).\n\nIndicators:\n- MACD: Very strong bullish momentum. MACD \u2248 4.28 vs signal \u2248 3.39, histogram \u2248 +0.88 and recently >1.0. This is a powerful upside impulse.\n- RSI: Overbought. Latest values ~71\u201381, currently ~71.8. This reflects extreme strength but also elevated risk of a sharp pullback.\n\nAccount and positions:\n- Balance: $88.44.\n- Equity: $88.44, margin: $0.00.\n- No open positions.\n- Risk tier: Balance < $100 \u2192 Max risk per trade = 20% of balance.\n  - Max_Risk_USD = 0.20 \u00d7 88.44 \u2248 $17.69 (small-account override allows up to $20 risk for 0.01 lot).\n\nContext and directional bias:\n- Strong intraday uptrend with a fresh breakout to new highs.\n- High tempo \u2192 by rules, counter-trend trades (shorts) are prohibited.\n- Only pullback longs in direction of the trend are allowed.\n\nTrade setup evaluation:\n\n1) Long at current price (~4235):\nWe must define SL/TP from market structure, then check R:R \u2265 1.5:1.\n\n- Logical SL: Below the last consolidation/pullback before the breakout.\n  - Recent structure: last minor base around 4220\u20134225; more conservative invalidation is below ~4220.\n  - Use SL \u2248 4220.0 (below that base).\n- Logical TP: Next structural liquidity above current high.\n  - Price just made a new high at 4238.25. A reasonable structural extension might be ~4248\u20134250 (round psychological area above the breakout).\n  - Use TP \u2248 4250.0.\n\nR:R calculation (BUY):\nEntry \u2248 4235.3\nSL \u2248 4220.0\nTP \u2248 4250.0\n\nRisk = 4235.3 - 4220.0 = 15.3\nReward = 4250.0 - 4235.3 = 14.7\nR:R = 14.7 / 15.3 \u2248 0.96:1\n\nThis is < 1.5:1, so it fails the R:R gatekeeper.\n\nCould we tighten SL structurally?\n- If we set SL just under the breakout level (e.g., 4228) to improve R:R:\n  - That level has just been broken; in a high-tempo breakout, a retest/wick back below 4228 is common without invalidating the trend.\n  - Using 4228 as SL is not a robust invalidation point; it\u2019s vulnerable noise.\n- Using non-structural tight stops would violate the rule that SL must be at clear invalidation.\n\nThus, any honest long from current price fails R:R \u2265 1.5:1.\n\n2) Waiting for a pullback:\n- A better long would be on a pullback to around 4220\u20134225 (prior high/structure) with:\n  - SL below ~4210\u20134212.\n  - TP back toward 4250+.\n- But price is currently at 4235; that pullback has not occurred, so there is no entry yet.\n\n3) Shorts:\n- Explicitly prohibited in high-tempo uptrend.\n- Also, shorting into such strong MACD/RSI without a clear reversal pattern is structurally poor.\n\nCheckpoints:\n- Post-loss cooldown: NO (last realized result was a win, and we have been flat since).\n- R:R Gatekeeper: All valid-structure trades from current price yield R:R < 1.5:1 \u2192 must HOLD.\n- Lot size/risk: Not reached, since R:R fails.\n\nGiven all this:\n- The correct action is to stay flat and wait for either:\n  - A pullback to a structural support zone (e.g., 4220\u20134225) for a potential long with \u22651.5:1 R:R, or\n  - A later, slower environment where counter-trend structures can be considered (once tempo drops and rules allow).\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: 0.00\nR:R: N/A (no candidate trade meets \u22651.5:1 with proper structure)\nRISK_TIER: 20%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: XAUUSD is in a high-tempo bullish breakout at new highs; shorts are prohibited and any structurally sound long from current price fails the \u22651.5:1 R:R requirement, so remaining flat best preserves capital while waiting for a pullback or clearer structural edge."

    "content": "Market/price overview:\n- Current XAUUSD price (last 15m close): ~4225.0.\n- Today\u2019s range: high 4240.5, low 4194.3; price has pulled back from the new high and is now in the upper half of the range but well off the peak.\n- Recent 15m structure:\n  - Strong breakout earlier: 4210\u20134215 area up to 4240.5.\n  - Last candle: 4235.8 open \u2192 4240.5 high \u2192 4218.4 low \u2192 4225.0 close, with a very long upper wick and large range. That\u2019s a clear rejection of the highs and a volatility spike.\n\nTempo classification:\n- Volatility is high: the most recent candle\u2019s range (~22 points) is significantly larger than prior bars.\n- We\u2019ve transitioned from a clean uptrend to a sharp, whipsaw-like rejection candle.\n\u2192 Tempo: HIGH, but now with reversal-type volatility rather than clean trend.\n\nIndicators:\n- MACD: Has flipped sharply bearish.\n  - Latest MACD value \u2248 -1.03 vs signal \u2248 0.38, histogram \u2248 -1.41 (strong negative).\n  - This is a rapid momentum reversal from the earlier highly positive values.\n- RSI: Dropped from overbought (~80) down into low/mid-40s.\n  - Latest RSI \u2248 46.2, with prior values in the mid-30s to low-40s during the drop.\n  - This confirms a strong corrective move off the highs, but RSI is not yet oversold (<30).\n\nAccount and positions:\n- Balance: $88.44.\n- Equity: $88.44, margin: $0.00.\n- No open positions.\n- Risk tier: Balance < $100 \u2192 Max risk per trade = 20%:\n  - Max_Risk_USD = 0.20 \u00d7 88.44 \u2248 $17.69 (small-account override up to $20 risk for 0.01 lot if structure valid).\n\nContext and directional bias:\n- We were in a strong intraday uptrend that just produced a blow-off top and sharp rejection.\n- High tempo remains, but now direction is less clear: we have a single large reversal candle, not yet a fully established downtrend.\n- Per rules, in high tempo we are prohibited from counter-trend trades. However, the \u201ctrend\u201d on the 15m has just been challenged; we must avoid flip-flopping on a single candle. Directional bias should not flip until there is a clear structural change (close beyond opposing swing by >1H ATR). From the data, we see one rejection candle but not a full structural flip with follow-through yet.\n\nTrade setup evaluation:\n\n1) New BUY (trend-following):\n- A long here would be buying into a sharp rejection, with MACD strongly negative and RSI mid-range. That\u2019s not a clean pullback in an intact trend; it\u2019s a volatility spike.\n- Logical SL for a long would be below the rejection low (~4218.4), perhaps around 4215.\n- Logical TP would be retest of the highs (4238\u20134240).\n  - Entry \u2248 4225\n  - SL \u2248 4215 \u2192 risk = 10\n  - TP \u2248 4238 \u2192 reward = 13\n  - R:R \u2248 13 / 10 = 1.3:1, still <1.5:1. And structurally, the trend is suspect after that rejection.\n\u2192 Fails R:R gatekeeper and is structurally questionable.\n\n2) New SELL (reversal/counter-trend):\n- High tempo conditions still apply. We are not yet in a clean downtrend; we have a single reversal candle after a strong uptrend.\n- Counter-trend trades in high tempo are prohibited by the strategy rules.\n- Even ignoring that, a structurally sound short would:\n  - Entry \u2248 4225\n  - SL above the high, say 4242 (above 4240.5 spike) \u2192 risk = 17\n  - TP at next major support, maybe 4200 (prior congestion) \u2192 reward = 25\n  - R:R \u2248 25 / 17 \u2248 1.47:1, slightly under 1.5:1.\n\u2192 Also fails the R:R \u2265 1.5:1 requirement, and violates the no-counter-trend-in-high-tempo rule.\n\nCheckpoint 2 (R:R Gatekeeper):\n- Both plausible BUY and SELL setups from here produce R:R < 1.5:1 when SL/TP are placed at realistic structural levels.\n- Therefore, by rule, all such trades must be rejected:\n  - REJECTED: R:R < 1.5:1 minimum.\n\nCheckpoint 3 (Risk) is not reached because we do not have a valid R:R setup.\n\nGiven:\n- High volatility and a fresh reversal candle make the environment dangerous.\n- The prior uptrend has been challenged, but a new, stable structure has not formed yet.\n- No trade from current price offers \u22651.5:1 R:R with proper structure.\n- No post-loss cooldown is active, but capital preservation mandates patience in this whipsaw zone.\n\nThe correct action this cycle is to stay flat and wait for:\n- Either a clearer, multi-candle structural reversal with consolidation to define better SL/TP, or\n- A new, orderly trend leg with pullbacks we can trade with proper R:R.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: 0.00\nR:R: N/A (all candidate setups <1.5:1)\nRISK_TIER: 20%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: After a blow-off top and sharp rejection, volatility is high and MACD has flipped negative; neither a long nor a short from current price can achieve \u22651.5:1 R:R with structurally sound SL/TP, so remaining flat best preserves capital until a clearer structure emerges."
