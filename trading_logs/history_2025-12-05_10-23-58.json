Target is the prior liquidity pocket around 4217\u20134218, with a tight 5-pt stop above the highs to keep risk contained while allowing for a mean-reversion move.\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4226.71\nTP: 4217.61\nSL: 4232.61\nREASON: Maintain the existing short as price remains at the upper edge of the daily range with resistance at 4228.23 intact, and intraday momentum metrics (RSI, MACD histogram) show loss of upside acceleration rather than a fresh breakout. No new trades are opened to avoid over-exposure; focus stays on letting this fade setup either play out toward the 4217 liquidity pocket or hit the predefined SL above resistance.\nDECISION: CLOSE\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4226.71\nTP: 4217.61 (not reached; manual close)\nSL: 4232.61 (not hit)\nREASON: Closed the short into profit as price moved off the session high and momentum flipped bearish, with current trade location drifting into mid-range where edge and R:R deteriorate. Remaining flat preserves gains and avoids forcing trades without a clear range edge or strong trend-follow signal.\nDECISION: SELL\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4227.61 (last M15 close; broker executed at market, ticket confirms)\nTP: 4217.61\nSL: 4232.61\nREASON: Short taken to fade an overbought spik...\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A (no trade)\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nREASON: Stay flat because current price is in the middle of the intraday range with conflicting signals (upward M15 bias vs short-term bearish MACD, neutral RSI), offering no clean edge or clear R:R \u2265 1.5 trade. I will wait for price to approach key support (\u22484216) or resistance (\u22484228\u20134230) before initiating the next scalp.\nDECISION: SELL\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4227.61 (last M15 close; broker executed at market, ticket confirms)\nTP: 4217.61\nSL: 4232.61\nREASON: Short taken to fade an overbought spik...\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A (no trade)\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nREASON: Stay flat because current price is in the upper-middle of the intraday range with bearish intraday momentum but no fresh touch of the 4228\u20134229 resistance that would justify a high-R:R fade. I will wait for price to revisit the range edge (resistance or support) or show a decisive breakout before deploying risk.\nDECISION: SELL\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4227.61 (last M15 close; broker executed at market, ticket confirms)\nTP: 4217.61\nSL: 4232.61\nREASON: Short taken to fade an overbought spik...\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A (no trade)\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nREASON: No trade because current price is mid-range with mixed signals and no clear high-R:R setup at a range edge or breakout level.

TP is set just above the 4220\u20134221 support band to harvest the likely mean-reversion swing, with SL parked above 4231 to cap risk if price breaks cleanly through resistance.\nDECISION: SELL\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4227.61 (last M15 close; broker executed at market, ticket confirms)\nTP: 4217.61\nSL: 4232.61\nREASON: Short taken to fade an overbought spik...\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4228.76\nTP: 4221.00\nSL: 4231.00\nREASON: Maintain the existing short because price is still trading just below the session high with resistance at 4229.5\u20134230.3 intact, and intraday MACD has flipped bearish while RSI is no longer overbought. The original fade thesis toward 4221\u20134222 remains valid, and closing now would cut the positive R:R profile without evidence of a bullish breakout invalidating the setup.\nDECISION: SELL\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4227.61 (last M15 close; broker executed at market, ticket confirms)\nTP: 4217.61\nSL: 4232.61\nREASON: Short taken to fade an overbought spik...\nDECISION: CLOSE\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4228.76\nTP: 4221.00 (not reached; manual close)\nSL: 4231.00 (not hit)\nREASON: Closed the existing short into strength of the move as price slid off the 4230.5 high and momentum turned decisively bearish, with current location sliding toward mid-range where the original asymmetric edge is no longer present. Staying flat preserves the win and avoids forcing new trades without a clear range-edge or breakout condition that offers R:R \u2265 1.5.\nDECISION: SELL\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4227.61 (last M15 close; broker executed at market, ticket confirms)\nTP: 4217.61\nSL: 4232.61\nREASON: Short taken to fade an overbought spik...\nDECISION: BUY\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: Market (~4224\u20134225, broker executed; ticket 35687805)\nTP: 4230.00\nSL: 4220.00\nREASON: Entered a long to play a bounce from the 4220\u20134225 support pocket after a sharp intraday selloff pushed RSI to 34.8 and MACD deeply negative, indicating potential seller exhaustion rather than fresh breakdown. TP is set just below the 4230 resistance cluster to capture a mean-reversion swing, with SL below 4220 to cut quickly if support fails.\nDECISION: SELL\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4227.61 (last M15 close; broker executed at market, ticket confirms)\nTP: 4217.61\nSL: 4232.61\nREASON: Short taken to fade an overbought spik...\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A (no new trade)\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nREASON: Closed the existing long to limit drawdown as the expected bounce from support did not materialize and momentum remained bearish, reducing the probability of hitting the 4230 TP before a stop-out. With current price action mid-range and indicators not at extremes, there is no clear statistical edge for a new scalp; capital is best preserved for a cleaner range-edge or breakout setup.\nDECISION: SELL\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4227.61 (last M15 close; broker executed at market, ticket confirms)\nTP: 4217.61\nSL: 4232.61\nREASON: Short taken to fade an overbought spik...\nDECISION: SELL\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: Market (~4225\u20134226, broker executed; ticket 35689936)\nTP: 4218.00\nSL: 4229.50\nREASON: Entered a short to fade the upper-region trade under the 4228.5\u20134230.5 resistance band after repeated failures to break the high of day and with price extended relative to the session\u2019s lower bound. The trade targets a rotation back into the 4218\u20134220 liquidity zone, using a tight protective stop above the resistance shelf to preserve capital if a clean breakout invalidates the mean-reversion thesis.\nDECISION: SELL\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4227.61 (last M15 close; broker executed at market, ticket confirms)\nTP: 4217.61\nSL: 4232.61\nREASON: Short taken to fade an overbought spik...\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4223.58\nTP: 4218.00\nSL: 4229.50\nREASON: Maintain the existing short because price is moving in favor of the position from the upper intraday band with bearish MACD and non-oversold RSI, and the 4218\u20134220 target zone remains technically valid. No adjustment is made yet to lock in profit, as the structure still supports a push into the lower liquidity pocket before any evidence of a sharp reversal or breakout above resistance.\nDECISION: SELL\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4227.61 (last M15 close; broker executed at market, ticket confirms)\nTP: 4217.61\nSL: 4232.61\nREASON: Short taken to fade an overbought spik...\nDECISION: HOLD (no new trade, keep existing position for now)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4223.58\nTP: 4218.00\nSL: 4229.50\nREASON: I will keep the existing short but not add or adjust yet: price is only ~1.4 pts against entry and still below the 4226\u20134228 resistance band where a clearer invalidation would occur, while risk remains well within limits. No new trades are opened because signals are mixed (bullish MACD vs price still under key resistance) and adding exposure here would degrade the overall R:R without a fresh, high\u2011edge setup at a range edge or a confirmed breakout.\nDECISION: SELL\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4227.61 (last M15 close; broker executed at market, ticket confirms)\nTP: 4217.61\nSL: 4232.61\nREASON: Short taken to fade an overbought spik...\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4223.58\nTP: 4218.00\nSL: 4229.50\nREASON: Keep the current short open because drawdown is small, structure still allows a rotation into 4218\u20134220, and there is no strong bullish evidence (RSI ~51, MACD only slightly positive) to justify an early exit. No new trades are opened since price is mid-range between clearly defined support and resistance, which fails the requirement for a high R:R \u2265 1.5 setup at a range edge or a clean breakout.\nDECISION: SELL\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4227.61 (last M15 close; broker executed at market, ticket confirms)\nTP: 4217.61\nSL: 4232.61\nREASON: Short taken to fade an overbought spik...\nReward to TP: 4223.25 \u2212 4218.00 = 5.25 pts (\u224852 pips) \u2192 \u2248$10.5\nDECISION: CLOSE\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4223.58\nTP: 4218.00 (not targeted; manual close)\nSL: 4229.50 (not hit)\nREASON: I choose to close the short because while momentum is mildly bearish, price is mid-range and the remaining R:R profile is unfavorable (<1:1), which does not meet the strategy requirement of R:R \u2265 1.5 for fresh risk deployment. Exiting here banks a small profit and frees margin to re-enter later at a clearer range edge (\u22484218\u20134220 or 4226\u20134228/4230.5) where a new scalp can be structured with materially better asymmetry.\nDECISION: SELL\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4227.61 (last M15 close; broker executed at market, ticket confirms)\nTP: 4217.61\nSL: 4232.61\nREASON: Short taken to fade an overbought spik...\nReward to TP: 4221.16 \u2212 4215.50 = 5.66 pts (\u224857 pips) \u2192 \u2248$11.3\nDECISION: SELL\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: Market (~4221.2; broker-set, see MT5)\nTP: 4215.50\nSL: 4225.50\nREASON: Executed a short to align with strong downside momentum (RSI < 40, deeply negative MACD) as price rotates away from the 4226\u20134228 resistance band toward the 4215\u20134218 liquidity pocket. The setup offers acceptable asymmetry with defined structure: SL just above the recent consolidation ceiling and TP into the next logical demand zone, consistent with the intraday scalper mandate in a high-tempo environment.\nDECISION: SELL\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4227.61 (last M15 close; broker executed at market, ticket confirms)\nTP: 4217.61\nSL: 4232.61\nREASON: Short taken to fade an overbought spik...\nCurrent Distance to SL: 4225.50 \u2212 4219.36 = 6.14 pts (\u224861 pips) \u2192 \u2248$12.3\nDistance to TP: 4219.36 \u2212 4215.50 = 3.86 pts (\u224839 pips) \u2192 \u2248$7.7\nDECISION: CLOSE\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4220.63\nTP: 4215.50 (not needed; manual close)\nSL: 4225.50 (not hit)\nREASON: I am closing the short into strength as price approaches the 4215\u20134218 support band with oversold\u2011leaning RSI (~34) and extended negative MACD, while the remaining reward to TP is smaller than the distance back to SL (R:R \u2248 0.63).

I will wait for price to approach the 4215\u20134216 support or 4223\u20134225 / 4227\u20134230 resistance bands before initiating the next intraday scalp.\nDECISION: SELL\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4227.61 (last M15 close; broker executed at market, ticket confirms)\nTP: 4217.61\nSL: 4232.61\nREASON: Short taken to fade an overbought spik...\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A (no trade)\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nREASON: I am staying flat because current price is mid\u2011range between nearby support (4215\u20134218) and resistance (4223\u20134225) with only moderate bullish momentum, which does not satisfy the strategy\u2019s requirement for a high\u2011edge range\u2011edge or breakout entry with R:R \u2265 1.5. I will wait for price to approach 4215\u20134217 (for a potential long) or 4223\u20134225 / 4227\u20134230.5 (for a potential short) before deploying risk.\nDECISION: SELL\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4227.61 (last M15 close; broker executed at market, ticket confirms)\nTP: 4217.61\nSL: 4232.61\nREASON: Short taken to fade an overbought spik...\nDECISION: SELL\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: Market (~4223\u20134224; broker-executed)\nTP: 4217.50\nSL: 4226.50\nREASON: I executed a short because price is trading at the upper segment of the intraday range (4223\u20134225) with RSI > 60 and strong but extended MACD, directly under a well-respected resistance band, making a mean-reversion move toward 4218\u20134220 statistically attractive. The stop at 4226.5 sits beyond the local resistance shelf to invalidate the fade, while the TP at 4217.5 is aligned with the lower liquidity pocket, maintaining R:R \u2248 2:1 within the allowed risk budget.\nDECISION: SELL\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4227.61 (last M15 close; broker executed at market, ticket confirms)\nTP: 4217.61\nSL: 4232.61\nREASON: Short taken to fade an overbought spik...\nTrigger: HOLD \u2013 Price is near local resistance, drawdown is small, TP:SL distance still favorable (\u22487.14 : 1.86 \u2248 3.8:1 from current), and no decisive bullish breakout above 4226/4227.\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4224.00\nTP: 4217.50\nSL: 4226.50\nREASON: I am keeping the existing short open because the position is only in mild drawdown, price is still trading just under resistance with RSI > 60 and no convincing breakout, and the remaining R:R from current price is still attractive (>3:1) toward the 4217.5 target. No new trades are added to avoid over\u2011exposure in a moderate\u2011tempo, range\u2011bound environment where the priority is letting the existing fade either reach its TP or be invalidated at the predefined SL.\nTrade executed: [SUMMARY OF CYCLES 1-1]\nDECISION: SELL\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4227.61 (last M15 close; broker executed at market, ticket confirms)\nTP: 4217.61\nSL: 4232.61\nREASON: Short taken to fade an overbought spik...\nTrade executed: {\"success\": true, \"account\": {\"balance\": 67.85, \"equity\": 65.15, \"margin\": 16.9, \"margin_free\": 48.25, \"margin_level\": 385.5029585798817, \"profit\": -2.7, \"currency\": \"USD\"}, \"positions\": [{\"ticket\": 3...\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4224.00\nTP: 4217.50\nSL: 4226.50\nREASON: I am maintaining the existing short because price remains at the upper band of the intraday range under key resistance with RSI > 60 but a now\u2011bearish MACD, which supports the original mean\u2011reversion thesis toward 4218\u20134220. The remaining risk is small relative to both account size and potential reward, so letting the trade play out toward either TP or SL is mathematically superior to exiting early in this moderate\u2011tempo, range\u2011bound environment.\n[END SUMMARY]"

The open short is in small drawdown with significantly more room to TP than to SL from current price, so statistically it is preferable to continue holding the position and let the mean\u2011reversion thesis toward 4218\u20134220 play out rather than exit early.\n\nDECISION: HOLD  \nSYMBOL: XAUUSD  \nENTRY: 4224.00  \nTICKET: 35701346  \nTP: 4217.50  \nSL: 4226.50  \nLOTS: 0.02  \nR:R: From current \u2248 (4224.60 \u2212 4217.50) / (4226.50 \u2212 4224.60) \u2248 7.10 / 1.90 \u2248 3.7  \nRISK_TIER: 20%  \nRISK_USD: \u2248$5.0 initial, \u2248$3.8 remaining  \n\nREASON: I am keeping the existing short open because price is still trading just below resistance in a tight range with clearly bearish MACD and non\u2011oversold RSI, preserving a favorable R:R profile toward the 4217.5 target. No new trades are opened or adjustments made, as adding exposure in this low\u2011range chop would not materially improve edge and would increase risk without a fresh, high\u2011conviction signal."

With RSI mid-50s and MACD only mildly negative, conditions are neither overbought nor oversold, and taking a fresh position here would mean entering mid-range without the required R:R \u2265 1.5 from a clear range edge or breakout structure.\n\nDECISION: CLOSE (executed)  \nSYMBOL: XAUUSD  \nENTRY: 4224.00  \nTICKET: 35701346  \nEXIT: 4226.42  \nTP: 4217.50 (not reached)  \nSL: 4226.50 (not hit; manual close slightly before)  \nLOTS: 0.02  \nR:R (realized): Loss \u2248 2.42 pts vs initial risk 2.50 pts \u2248 0.97R  \nRISK_TIER: 20%  \nRISK_USD: -$4.84 realized  \n\nREASON: I closed the short because price action has drifted high enough toward resistance that the original mean-reversion edge is eroded, while remaining downside to the intended TP is no longer attractive relative to the risk of a continued grind higher. After this loss, I will remain flat and wait for a clearer setup at 4218\u20134220 (for potential long) or 4227\u20134230.5 (for potential short) before redeploying risk."
