[2025-12-03 00:11:22] Agent Response: Market analysis:

1) Price action and tempo (15m data)
- Current price: last 15m close ≈ 4212–4213.
- Today’s range: high 4230.31, low 4163.47, close 4213.46. Price is in the upper half of today’s range but below intraday high.
- Recent structure (last few hours):  
  - Strong bounce from 4163–4170 up to 4220–4230 earlier in the session.  
  - Since then, price has been oscillating roughly 4185–4225, with the latest candles showing a pullback from ~4225 to ~4208–4213.
- Volatility/tempo:  
  - Candle bodies are moderate, not exploding relative to prior 24h.  
  - No clear runaway breakout beyond the day’s range right now.  
  → Tempo: MODERATE (Sniper Mode). Range trading at edges is allowed; no need for aggressive trend chasing.

2) Indicators
- MACD (minute-based, short-term):  
  - MACD value is negative, signal is slightly positive, histogram is negative and widening.  
  - This reflects short-term bearish momentum after the intraday pullback.
- RSI (minute-based):  
  - Latest RSI ≈ 45 (recent values mostly 34–49).  
  - Not oversold (<30) or overbought (>70). No extreme condition.
- Overall: short-term momentum is mildly bearish within a broader intraday range, not a strong trending environment.

3) Structure and levels (from 15m)
- Support zones:  
  - 4185–4190 (repeated reactions and clustering of lows around 4186–4190).  
  - Stronger structural low: 4163–4170 (today’s low).
- Resistance zones:  
  - 4218–4225 (multiple touches, recent local high and rejection).  
  - Above that, 4230+ is the daily high area.
- Current price (~4212–4213) is mid-range between 4185 support and 4225 resistance.  
  - For range trading, best entries are near 4185 (buy) or 4225 (sell), not mid-range.

4) Account and risk context
- Balance: $85.36
- Risk tier: < $100 → 15% max risk per trade.
- Max risk per trade: 85.36 × 0.15 ≈ $12.80
- No open positions; no recent loss recorded in this session → no post-loss lockout.

5) Check for valid setups per rules

A) High-tempo trend-following?  
- No: tempo is moderate, not high. Trend-only rule doesn’t apply.

B) Range trading at edges (Sniper Mode)?
- To buy: ideal entry would be close to 4185–4190 with SL just below 4183 and TP toward 4218–4225. Current price (~4212–4213) is ~25 points above that support; entering now would mean a wider, less-structured stop and worse R:R.
- To sell: ideal entry at 4220–4225 with SL above 4230 and TP toward 4190. Current price is below that resistance; we would be “chasing” and not entering at the edge.
- Since we are mid-range, we do NOT have an “at the edge” range trade that satisfies structural SL/TP and good R:R.

C) Counter-trend mid-range reversal (requires all 3 confluences)
- We are mid-range, so this logic could apply, but:
  1) RSI extreme? No (≈45, not <30 or >70).
  2) MACD divergence? Data only shows current negative momentum, no clear divergence signal from the tool output.
  3) Structural retest (2+ rejections)? Not at current price; the repeated rejections are around 4185 and 4220–4225, not here.
- All three confluences are not met → counter-trend mid-range trade is prohibited.

D) R:R gatekeeper and risk sizing
- Any attempt to force a trade from current ~4212 would either:
  - Place SL too close (not at a true invalidation swing), or
  - Place SL at the correct structural level (e.g., below 4183 or above 4230) but then the nearest logical TP would not give a clean ≥1.5:1 R:R in the direction of current short-term momentum without over-optimistic targets.
- Therefore, no structurally sound trade from this price with R:R ≥ 1.5 that also respects the strategy constraints.

6) Checkpoints before any trade

Checkpoint 1: Post-loss cooldown  
- Not in a cooldown. Pass.

Checkpoint 2: R:R Gatekeeper  
- From current mid-range price, any reasonable structure-based SL/TP fails the ≥1.5:1 R:R requirement for a clean, rule-compliant setup.  
- Therefore: REJECTED: No candidate trade meets the R:R ≥ 1.5:1 minimum from current level.

Checkpoint 3: Lot size & risk  
- Not reached, because we already fail Checkpoint 2.

Conclusion:
- Market is in a moderate-tempo range.
- Price is mid-range, not at key support/resistance.
- Indicators do not show an extreme or divergence-based reversal signal.
- No valid trade with R:R ≥ 1.5 and proper structural SL/TP from the current price.

Per the Prime Directive (capital preservation) and rules, the correct action is to HOLD and wait for a better location (near 4185–4190 or 4220–4225) before committing risk.

[2025-12-03 00:26:56] Agent Response: Market analysis:

1) Price action and tempo (15m)
- Latest 15m candle: open 4208.79, high 4211.56, low 4206.48, close 4206.69.
- Today’s daily stats (still same session): high 4230.31, low 4163.47, close reference 4213.46.
- Current price ≈ 4206–4207, still within the same broad intraday range.
- Recent hours: price has been oscillating mostly 4185–4225 without a decisive breakout.
- Candle sizes are moderate, not expanding aggressively vs earlier in the day.
→ Tempo classification: MODERATE (Sniper Mode). Not high-tempo trend; not ultra-compressed either.

2) Indicators (short-term, minute-based)
- MACD:
  - Values are negative, signal also negative, histogram recently turned more negative again (last value ≈ -0.27).
  - Indicates short-term bearish momentum has re-strengthened after a brief attempt to recover.
- RSI:
  - Latest RSI ≈ 36 (recent values mostly 36–55).
  - Not oversold (<30) or overbought (>70). Mildly bearish, but no extreme.

3) Structure and key levels (from 15m data)
- Support:
  - 4185–4190: repeated cluster of lows and bounces (notably around 4186–4190).
  - Stronger support: 4163–4170 (today’s low area).
- Resistance:
  - 4218–4225: repeated rejections and prior local highs.
  - Above that: ~4230–4231 is the daily high.
- Current price ~4206–4207 is again mid-range between 4185 support and 4220–4225 resistance.

4) Account and risk
- Balance: $85.36
- Risk tier: 15% (balance < $100)
- Max risk per trade: 85.36 × 0.15 ≈ $12.80
- No open positions, no recent loss in this session → no post-loss lockout.

5) Strategy rule check

A) High-tempo trend-following?
- Market is not in high-tempo breakout mode; price remains inside the established daily range.
- So we stay in Sniper Mode, not aggressive trend-only mode.

B) Range trading at edges
- Ideal long setup: buy near 4185–4190, SL just below 4183, TP toward 4218–4225.
- Ideal short setup: sell near 4220–4225, SL above 4230, TP toward 4190.
- Current price ~4206 is in the middle, not at the edge. Entering here would mean:
  - Buying: SL still best placed below 4183; TP at 4220–4225. While R:R could be okay mathematically, we’d be entering mid-range, not at support, which violates the “entry AT the level” requirement for range trades.
  - Selling: Similarly, not at resistance; we’d be shorting into the middle, not the edge.
- Per rules, range trades must be taken at the edge with tight, structural stops. That’s not the case here.

C) Counter-trend mid-range reversal (requires all 3 confluences)
We are mid-range, so this protocol would apply, but:
  1) RSI extreme? No (≈36, not <30 or >70).
  2) MACD divergence? Tool output shows consistent negative momentum; no clear divergence.
  3) Structural retest (2+ rejections) at current level? No; rejections are around 4185 and 4220–4225, not here.
→ All three confluences are not present; counter-trend mid-range trade is prohibited.

D) R:R and risk sizing
- Any trade from ~4206 with a structurally sound SL (below 4183 for longs, above 4230 for shorts) and logical TP (4185 or 4220+ depending on direction) either:
  - Violates the “enter at the level, not mid-range” rule, or
  - Forces an optimistic TP beyond the next clear structure to reach ≥1.5 R:R, which we are not allowed to do.
- Therefore, no candidate setup passes the R:R gatekeeper in a way that also respects entry location rules.

6) Checkpoints

Checkpoint 1: Post-loss cooldown
- Not in cooldown. Pass.

Checkpoint 2: R:R Gatekeeper
- From current mid-range price, any structurally valid SL/TP that respects our strategy does not yield a clean, rule-compliant ≥1.5:1 R:R entry from here.
- So: REJECTED: No current setup with R:R ≥ 1.5:1 that obeys structural and entry rules.

Checkpoint 3: Lot size & risk
- Not reached because we already fail Checkpoint 2.

Conclusion:
- Market remains in a moderate-tempo range.
- Price is still mid-range, not at key support/resistance.
- Indicators show mild bearish pressure but no extremes or divergence.
- No valid, high-probability setup that meets R:R and structural rules from the current location.

Per the Prime Directive (capital preservation) and the strategy constraints, I must HOLD and wait for price to approach 4185–4190 or 4220–4225 before committing risk.

[2025-12-03 00:42:37] Agent Response: Market analysis:

1) Price action and tempo (15m)
- Latest 15m candle: open 4206.43, high 4211.07, low 4206.11, close 4206.65.
- Recent candles around 4206–4210 show very tight ranges and small bodies.
- Daily context (same as prior): high 4230.31, low 4163.47, reference close 4213.46. Current price ~4206 is near the daily VWAP (4205.2), in the middle of the broader range.
- Volatility: candles are smaller than earlier in the session; price is compressing around 4205–4210.
→ Tempo classification: LOW to LOW-MODERATE. This is a choppy, consolidating environment, not a strong trend or breakout.

2) Indicators (minute-based)
- MACD:
  - MACD value is negative, signal also negative; histogram recently turned positive but is small and now slightly negative again.
  - This reflects fading momentum and indecision rather than a clear trend.
- RSI:
  - Latest RSI ≈ 41 (recently oscillating roughly 38–60).
  - Not overbought or oversold; neutral to mildly bearish.

3) Structure and levels (from 15m)
- Support:
  - 4185–4190: repeated cluster of lows and bounces.
  - Stronger: 4163–4170 (session low).
- Resistance:
  - 4218–4225: repeated rejections and local highs.
  - Above: ~4230–4231 daily high.
- Current price ~4206 is again mid-range between 4185 support and 4220–4225 resistance, and also near VWAP.

4) Account and risk
- Balance: $85.36
- Risk tier: 15% (balance < $100)
- Max risk per trade: 85.36 × 0.15 ≈ $12.80
- No open positions; no recent loss → no post-loss lockout.

5) Strategy rule check

A) Tempo mode
- Tempo is LOW/LOW-MODERATE.
- Rules: in low tempo, be conservative; default to HOLD, avoid forcing trades.

B) Range trading at edges (Sniper Mode)
- To buy: ideal near 4185–4190 with SL just below 4183, TP toward 4218–4225 (clear edge-to-edge idea).
- To sell: ideal near 4220–4225 with SL above 4230, TP toward 4190.
- We are not at either edge; we are mid-range around 4206.
- Entry must be AT the level (support/resistance) with tight, structural stops. Entering here would violate that requirement.

C) Counter-trend mid-range reversal (requires 3 confluences)
- RSI extreme (<30 or >70)? No.
- MACD divergence? Data shows small shifts but no clear divergence pattern from the tool output.
- Structural retest (2+ rejections) at current level? No; rejections are concentrated near 4185 and 4220–4225, not at 4206.
→ All three confluences are not present; counter-trend mid-range trades are prohibited.

D) R:R and risk sizing
- Any trade from ~4206 with a structurally sound SL (below 4183 / above 4230) and logical TP (next support/resistance) either:
  - Enters mid-range instead of at the level, violating entry rules, or
  - Forces TP beyond a logical structural target just to meet ≥1.5:1, which is not allowed.
- So, even if some raw R:R could be engineered, it would not be structurally valid per the rules.

6) Checkpoints

Checkpoint 1: Post-loss cooldown
- Not in cooldown. Pass.

Checkpoint 2: R:R Gatekeeper
- No candidate trade from current price satisfies both structural SL/TP placement and ≥1.5:1 R:R.
- REJECTED: No valid setup with R:R ≥ 1.5:1 that respects structure and entry rules.

Checkpoint 3: Lot size & risk
- Not reached, as we already fail Checkpoint 2.

Conclusion:
- Market is quieting into low-tempo consolidation around VWAP.
- Price is mid-range, not at a clear edge.
- Indicators are neutral; no extremes, no divergence-based reversal.
- Per Prime Directive and low-tempo guidance, forcing a trade here would be unjustified risk.

1) Price action and tempo (15m)
- Latest 15m candle: open 4207.14, high 4209.26, low 4204.39, close 4209.26, volume 2016.
- Recent several candles: all clustered 4205–4211 with small ranges and overlapping bodies.
- Daily context: high 4230.31, low 4163.47, reference close 4213.46, VWAP ≈ 4205.21. Current price ~4209 is very close to VWAP and mid-range of the day.
- No breakout beyond intraday extremes; price is consolidating in a tight band.

→ Tempo classification: LOW to LOW-MODERATE. Volatility is compressed; this is a choppy equilibrium zone, not a strong trend.

2) Indicators (minute-based)
- MACD:
  - MACD value is negative but rising toward the signal; histogram has flipped positive (≈ +0.36 latest).
  - This indicates short-term bullish momentum emerging from a previously bearish phase, but the magnitude is modest.
- RSI:
  - Latest RSI ≈ 59 (recent values mostly 36–59).
  - Slightly bullish but not overbought; no extreme.

3) Structure and key levels (from 15m)
- Support:
  - 4185–4190: repeated lows and bounces (clear intraday support).
  - Stronger: 4163–4170 (session low).
- Resistance:
  - 4218–4225: repeated rejections and local highs.
  - Above: ~4230–4231 daily high.
- Current price ~4209 is in the middle between 4185 support and 4220–4225 resistance, and right around VWAP.

4) Account and risk
- Balance: $85.36
- Risk tier: 15% (balance < $100)
- Max risk per trade: 85.36 × 0.15 ≈ $12.80
- No open positions; no realized loss → no post-loss lockout.

5) Strategy and setup evaluation

A) Tempo mode
- Tempo is low; rules say be conservative, default to HOLD unless a very clean edge setup appears.

B) Range trading at edges (Sniper Mode)
- Long idea: buy near 4185–4190 with SL just below 4183, TP toward 4218–4225.
- Short idea: sell near 4220–4225 with SL above 4230, TP toward ~4190.
- Current price 4209 is not at either edge; it is mid-range. Entering here would violate the requirement: “Entry is AT the level (not chasing).”

C) Counter-trend mid-range reversal (requires all 3 confluences)
- RSI extreme? No (≈59, not >70 or <30).
- MACD divergence? Data shows a normal momentum shift, not a clear divergence.
- Structural retest at current level? No; the multi-touch zones are 4185 and 4220–4225, not 4209.
→ Conditions for counter-trend mid-range trade are not met; such trades are prohibited.

D) R:R and risk
- Any trade from ~4209 with a proper structural SL (below 4183 or above 4230) and logical TP (next support/resistance) either:
  - Enters mid-range instead of at the edge (breaking rules), or
  - Forces an unrealistic TP beyond the next clear level just to reach ≥1.5:1 R:R.
- Therefore, no structurally valid, high-probability setup from this price.

6) Checkpoints

Checkpoint 1: Post-loss cooldown
- Not in cooldown. Pass.

Checkpoint 2: R:R Gatekeeper
- No candidate trade from current level satisfies both structural SL/TP placement and ≥1.5:1 R:R.
- REJECTED: No valid setup meeting the minimum R:R requirement.

Checkpoint 3: Lot size & risk
- Not reached, because we already fail Checkpoint 2 and entry-location rules.

Conclusion:
- Market is in low-tempo consolidation around VWAP and mid-range.
- Price is not at a key support or resistance edge.
- Indicators show mild bullishness but no extreme or divergence-based opportunity.
- Per Prime Directive and low-tempo guidance, forcing a trade here would be unjustified risk.

1) Price action and tempo (15m)
- Latest 15m candle: open 4211.13, high 4221.00, low 4209.91, close 4216.53, volume 2684.
- This candle broke above the prior tight 4205–4210 consolidation and pushed into the 4216–4221 zone.
- Daily context: high 4230.31, low 4163.47, reference close 4213.46, VWAP ≈ 4205.21. Current price ~4216.5 is above VWAP and approaching the known resistance band 4218–4225, but still below the daily high.

→ Tempo classification: HIGHER than before, moving from low/moderate into a more impulsive, bullish move. However, we are entering a resistance zone, not a clean breakout beyond it.

2) Indicators (minute-based)
- MACD:
  - Strongly positive and rising; histogram > 0 and expanding (latest ≈ +0.005 after a strong run; prior values up to ~+0.8).
  - Confirms strong short-term bullish momentum.
- RSI:
  - Recent values peaked above 70–76 and have now cooled slightly to ~61.
  - This indicates the market was overbought on the thrust up into 4220 and is now easing, but still elevated.

3) Structure and key levels
- Support:
  - 4185–4190: well-defined intraday support.
  - Stronger: 4163–4170 (session low).
- Resistance:
  - 4218–4225: repeated rejections and local highs; we are just below/inside this zone now.
  - Above: ~4230–4231 daily high.
- Current price ~4216.5 sits right below the 4218–4225 resistance band that has repeatedly capped price.

4) Account and risk
- Balance: $85.36
- Risk tier: 15% (balance < $100)
- Max risk per trade: 85.36 × 0.15 ≈ $12.80
- No open positions; no realized losses → no post-loss lockout.

5) Strategy evaluation

A) Tempo mode
- We see a strong upward impulse, but price is running directly into a well-defined resistance band (4218–4225) and is still inside the broader daily range.
- This is not yet a clean breakout beyond the range; it is a test of resistance.
- Given our rules, we must be cautious about treating this as a high-tempo trend continuation because we are at/near the range edge, not in the middle of a breakout.

B) Range trading at edges (Sniper Mode)
- Short idea (sell resistance):
  - Ideal entry: 4218–4220 area (top of current thrust, within resistance band).
  - Structural SL: above 4230 (beyond daily high and clear invalidation of the range-sell idea).
  - Logical TP: toward 4190 (support cluster).
  - From a hypothetical entry at 4220:
    - SL at 4231 → SL distance = 11 points.
    - TP at 4190 → TP distance = 30 points.
    - R:R = 30 / 11 ≈ 2.73:1 → passes R:R ≥ 1.5 requirement.
- However, our current last close is 4216.5, not 4220+. The rule says: “Entry is AT the level (not chasing).”
  - If we sell now at 4216.5 with SL 4231 and TP 4190:
    - SL distance = 14.5 points.
    - TP distance = 26.5 points.
    - R:R = 26.5 / 14.5 ≈ 1.83:1 → still ≥ 1.5, but entry is not exactly at the resistance edge; it’s slightly below.
  - The structural idea is still “sell resistance,” but we are entering a bit early. Given the recent strong bullish impulse and MACD/RSI strength, fading this move before it actually tags the resistance band is aggressive and borderline counter-trend.

C) Counter-trend rules in higher tempo
- The recent move is a strong upward impulse (bullish). In high-tempo conditions, counter-trend trades are prohibited; only pullbacks in the direction of the trend are allowed.
- Here, a sell at 4216.5–4220 would be counter to the immediate bullish impulse.
- Even though the overall daily structure is a range, the immediate 15m trend is clearly up.
- Combined with RSI having just been overbought and MACD strongly positive, shorting now would be a pure fade of momentum, which conflicts with the “no counter-trend in high tempo” rule.

D) Long breakout idea?
- Buying here would mean:
  - Entry ~4216.5.
  - SL below 4210 or deeper (e.g., below 4205 or 4198) for structural safety.
  - TP above 4230 (new highs).
- But we are buying directly into a well-defined resistance band (4218–4225) that has capped price repeatedly. Structural TP would have to be significantly above 4230 to get R:R ≥ 1.5, which becomes speculative.
- This does not satisfy the “TP at the next logical liquidity pool/resistance” rule without stretching targets.

Conclusion on setups:
- Shorting: good R:R on paper, but violates the “no counter-trend in high tempo” guidance and is early relative to the resistance edge.
- Buying: trades into resistance with questionable structural R:R and poor location.
- Therefore, despite apparent opportunity, the rule set and capital-preservation focus argue strongly to WAIT and see if:
  - Price rejects clearly from 4218–4225 and tempo slows (then a range short could be considered), or
  - Price breaks and holds above 4230 with momentum (then trend-following longs on pullbacks become valid).

6) Checkpoints

Checkpoint 1: Post-loss cooldown
- Not in cooldown. Pass.

Checkpoint 2: R:R Gatekeeper
- A mathematically valid R:R ≥ 1.5 exists for a range short, but it would be counter-trend in a high-tempo bullish impulse and slightly early relative to the resistance edge. The strategy disallows such counter-trend trades in this tempo context.
- So, even though R:R passes, the trade is invalid per directional/tempo rules.

Checkpoint 3: Lot size & risk
- Not reached, because no trade passes the directional/tempo constraints.

Final decision:
- Strong short-term bullish momentum is pushing into a known resistance band.
- Our rules prohibit counter-trend fading in high-tempo conditions and discourage buying directly into resistance without a clean breakout and pullback structure.
- To protect capital, the correct action is to HOLD and wait for clearer structure (either rejection from 4218–4225 or a confirmed breakout above 4230 and retest).

- Latest 15m candle: open 4216.62, high 4219.59, low 4213.89, close 4215.38, volume 2357.
- Previous candle: strong upthrust from ~4210 to a high of 4221, closing 4216.63.
- Price is oscillating between roughly 4210 and 4220, with wicks into the 4218–4220 area.
- Daily context (unchanged): high 4230.31, low 4163.47, reference close 4213.46, VWAP ≈ 4205.21. Current price ~4215 is slightly above VWAP and below daily high.
- Volatility: candles are moderate-sized, not extreme; the sharpest expansion was the prior up-candle, now followed by a smaller inside-ish bar.

→ Tempo: MODERATE. There was a brief high-tempo push up, but now price is pausing under resistance rather than exploding further.

2) Indicators (minute-based)
- MACD:
  - MACD value remains positive but is declining toward the signal; histogram is negative and widening (latest ≈ -0.64).
  - This shows bullish momentum has peaked and is now fading.
- RSI:
  - Recently peaked in the mid-60s; now cooled to ~48.
  - No longer overbought; neutral to slightly bullish.

3) Structure and key levels
- Support:
  - 4185–4190: well-defined intraday support cluster.
  - Stronger: 4163–4170 (session low).
- Resistance:
  - 4218–4225: multiple prior rejections; current highs are testing the lower part of this band (today’s recent high 4221).
  - Above: ~4230–4231 daily high.
- Current price ~4215 is just beneath the 4218–4220 resistance zone and below the recent high at 4221.

4) Account and risk
- Balance: $85.36
- Risk tier: 15% (balance < $100)
- Max risk per trade: 85.36 × 0.15 ≈ $12.80
- No open positions; no realized losses → no post-loss lockout.

5) Strategy evaluation

A) Tempo and directional context
- Immediate 15m trend is still up from the 4185–4190 base, but momentum is clearly slowing as price presses into resistance.
- Tempo is now moderate, not clearly high. That allows range trading if we are at an edge and meet R:R and structure rules.

B) Range short at resistance (Sniper Mode)
We are very close to the range top:

Candidate setup:
- Direction: SELL (fade resistance).
- Entry: around current price 4215.4 (just under resistance band 4218–4220).
- Stop Loss (SL): above daily high and resistance, e.g. 4231.0 (beyond 4230.31).
- Take Profit (TP): toward support zone, e.g. 4190.0.

R:R calculation (SELL):
- Entry ≈ 4215.4
- TP = 4190.0 → TP distance = 4215.4 - 4190.0 = 25.4 points
- SL = 4231.0 → SL distance = 4231.0 - 4215.4 = 15.6 points
- R:R = TP_distance / SL_distance = 25.4 / 15.6 ≈ 1.63:1 → passes ≥ 1.5 requirement.

Location and structure:
- Entry is slightly below the 4218–4220 resistance band, not at its absolute top, but price has already wicked into 4219.6 and pulled back, indicating sellers above.
- We have:
  - Clear resistance overhead (4218–4225).
  - Logical invalidation above 4230/4231.
  - Logical TP at the 4190 support cluster.
- Tempo is moderate, not high, and MACD/RSI show waning bullish momentum.
- This is a range fade at the upper third of the range with acceptable structure and R:R.

C) Counter-trend rules
- Is this counter-trend? The microtrend is up, but the broader intraday structure is a range 4185–4230. We are fading the move at the range top, which is allowed in moderate tempo Sniper Mode, provided R:R ≥ 2:1 ideally, but rules specify ≥ 1.5:1 as the hard minimum and ≥ 2:1 for ideal range fades.
- We have 1.63:1, above the minimum. It’s not perfect 2:1, but within the allowed rules, and the structure is clear.

D) Checkpoints

Checkpoint 1: Post-loss cooldown
- Not in cooldown. Pass.

Checkpoint 2: R:R Gatekeeper
- For SELL at 4215.4 with TP 4190 and SL 4231:
  - R:R ≈ 1.63:1 ≥ 1.5.
- Pass.

Checkpoint 3: Lot size & risk validation
- Balance: $85.36
- Risk tier: 15%
- Max Risk_USD = 85.36 × 0.15 ≈ $12.80
- Stop distance: 4231.0 - 4215.4 = 15.6 points

Assume pip/point value for XAUUSD ≈ $1.00 per point per 0.01 lot (per instructions).

Risk per 0.01 lot:
- Risk_0.01 = 15.6 points × $1.00 ≈ $15.60

This exceeds our max risk $12.80, so 0.01 lot is too large at this stop distance.

We must reduce lot size:
- Required lot size = Max_Risk_USD / (Stop_Distance × Pip_Value_per_0.01)
- = 12.80 / 15.6 ≈ 0.82 (in units of 0.01 lot) → 0.0082 lots.
- Brokers typically have a minimum of 0.01 lot, and we must not round up.
- Since 0.01 lot already exceeds the max risk, and we cannot go smaller than 0.01, this trade is not viable under our risk constraints with a structurally correct stop.

We could try tightening SL closer, but that would:
- Move SL inside the resistance band, no longer at a clear invalidation beyond the swing high/daily high.
- That would violate the structural SL rule.

Therefore, despite a structurally valid concept and acceptable R:R, the minimum tradable lot size (0.01) would risk more than our allowed 15%, and tightening the stop to fit risk would break structure.

Per rules, if Actual Risk > Max Risk and cannot be reduced by decreasing lot size (due to broker/minimum), we must HOLD.

Conclusion:
- Setup idea: short near resistance with good R:R and structure.
- However, with our small account and the structural stop required, even the smallest lot size (0.01) risks more than our allowed 15%.
- We are not allowed to violate risk limits or compromise structural SL placement.

Therefore, no trade can be executed safely right now.

[2025-12-03 01:45:23] Agent Response: Market analysis:

1) Price action and tempo (15m)
- Latest 15m candle: open 4215.36, high 4218.88, low 4213.07, close 4216.47, volume 2487.
- Last few candles: tight oscillation between ~4213 and ~4219, with repeated probes into the 4218–4219 area and closes around 4215–4217.
- Daily context: high 4230.31, low 4163.47, ref close 4213.46, VWAP ≈ 4205.21. Current price ~4216.5 is slightly above VWAP and still below daily high.
- Volatility: moderate but not expanding; candles are similar in size, overlapping, indicating consolidation just under resistance.

→ Tempo: MODERATE. Not high-tempo breakout; not low-compression either. We are in a controlled range near the upper band.

2) Indicators (minute-based)
- MACD:
  - MACD has recently crossed below its signal; histogram is negative (latest ≈ -0.03 to -0.1).
  - This shows short-term bullish momentum has faded and is slightly tilting bearish.
- RSI:
  - Latest RSI ≈ 54–55 (recent values mostly low-40s to high-50s).
  - Neutral to mildly bullish; no overbought/oversold extremes.

3) Structure and key levels
- Support:
  - 4185–4190: intraday support cluster.
  - Stronger: 4163–4170 session low.
- Resistance:
  - 4218–4225: repeated rejections; current highs into 4218–4219 confirm this band.
  - Above: 4230–4231 daily high.
- Current price ~4216.5 is just under the 4218–4220 resistance zone and below 4225.

4) Account and risk
- Balance: $85.36
- Risk tier: 15% (balance < $100)
- Max risk per trade: 85.36 × 0.15 ≈ $12.80
- No open positions; no realized losses → no post-loss cooldown.

5) Strategy evaluation

A) Context
- We are near the upper edge of an established range (resistance 4218–4225).
- Momentum is no longer strongly bullish; MACD is softening, RSI neutral.
- Tempo is moderate, which allows range trading (Sniper Mode) if R:R and structure are sound.

B) Range short at resistance
Candidate idea:
- SELL near current price (4216.5), targeting the 4190 support area.

Structural levels:
- Entry: 4216.5 (current area).
- SL: above daily high/clear invalidation, e.g. 4231.0 (beyond 4230.31).
- TP: 4190.0 (support cluster).

R:R (SELL):
- TP distance = 4216.5 - 4190.0 = 26.5 points.
- SL distance = 4231.0 - 4216.5 = 14.5 points.
- R:R = 26.5 / 14.5 ≈ 1.83:1 → passes ≥ 1.5 minimum.

This is a valid range-fade concept structurally and by R:R.

C) Risk and lot size constraint
- Max risk: $12.80.
- Stop distance: 14.5 points.
- Pip value: ≈ $1.00 per point per 0.01 lot (per instructions).

Risk per 0.01 lot:
- 14.5 points × $1.00 ≈ $14.50 risk.

This exceeds the allowed $12.80. We must compute the maximum allowable lot:

Required lot size (in 0.01-lot units):
- 12.80 / 14.5 ≈ 0.883 → 0.00883 lots.

We must not round up and typical minimum tradable size is 0.01 lot. Since:
- 0.01 lot risk ($14.50) > max allowed ($12.80)
- And we cannot go below 0.01 lot,

This trade cannot be executed without violating our risk cap.

Tightening SL to fit 0.01 lot inside risk would push SL inside the resistance band and no longer at a true invalidation point, breaking the structural SL rule. That is not allowed.

D) Long breakout?
- Buying here would be directly into resistance 4218–4225, with SL likely below 4210/4205 and TP above 4230.
- To get ≥1.5:1 R:R, TP would need to be set well above the next logical resistance (4230), which is speculative and not permitted by structure-based TP rules.
- So no valid long setup either.

6) Checkpoints

Checkpoint 1: Post-loss cooldown
- Not in cooldown. Pass.

Checkpoint 2: R:R Gatekeeper
- Range short concept: R:R ≈ 1.83:1 → passes.
- However, risk constraints at minimum lot size cannot be met; this effectively invalidates the trade for our account.

Checkpoint 3: Lot size & risk
- With structural SL, 0.01 lot risks ~$14.50 > $12.80 max.
- We cannot reduce below 0.01 lot.
- Therefore, Actual Risk would be above Max Risk → trade must be rejected.

Conclusion:
- Structurally, a short near resistance is attractive, but with our small account and proper structural stop, the minimum lot risks too much.
- No other setup (long or short) satisfies both R:R and risk constraints with valid structure.

Per Prime Directive and risk rules, I must not force a trade.

[2025-12-03 05:52:53] Agent Response: Market/price overview:
- Instrument: XAUUSD
- Current 15m price area: ~4210 (last close 4207.97)
- Previous daily summary (2025-12-02): High 4230.31, Low 4163.47, Close 4213.46, VWAP ~4205.21
- Intraday structure (last several hours): Price has been oscillating mostly between ~4204 and ~4228 with no clean breakout; recent candles are relatively small and overlapping.

Tempo classification:
- 15m ranges are mostly ~5–10 points, not significantly larger than earlier in the session.
- No strong directional push beyond the recent intraday highs (~4228) or lows (~4203).
- This is a MODERATE-to-LOW tempo, mildly ranging environment. No clear, impulsive trend leg currently in progress.

Indicators (1H):
- MACD: Value has crossed from negative toward positive, histogram strongly positive → suggests bullish momentum developing on the 1H, but not an explosive trend.
- RSI (14): ~48–58 zone recently → neutral to mildly bullish, far from overbought/oversold extremes. No clear reversal signal.

Structure / context:
- Price is sitting close to yesterday’s close and VWAP (~4205–4213); effectively in the mid-range of the prior day’s high/low.
- Local support: ~4203–4206 (multiple 15m lows and bounces).
- Local resistance: ~4225–4228 (recent 15m highs).
- Current location is mid-range, not at clear support or resistance extremes.

Account / risk:
- Balance: $85.36
- According to rules: Balance < $100 → Max risk 20% per trade = $17.07, with small-account override allowing up to $20 risk if 0.01 lot slightly exceeds 20%.
- No open positions on XAUUSD or elsewhere.
- No prior-cycle loss mentioned in this session, so no post-loss cooldown is active.

Trading opportunity assessment vs rules:

1) Post-loss cooldown checkpoint:
- Not in a post-loss lockout.
- CHECKPOINT 1 PASSED.

2) Is there a valid setup with R:R ≥ 1.5?
- High-tempo trend-following: Not applicable; tempo is moderate/low and structure is not strongly trending.
- Range trading at edges: To buy, we’d want entries near support (~4203–4205) with SL below that (e.g., ~4198) and TP near resistance (~4225–4228). Current price is around 4208–4210, i.e., mid-range, not “at the edge.” Entering now would mean:
  - SL structurally still needs to go below ~4203.
  - TP structurally should be near 4225–4228.
  - While R:R might be acceptable numerically, the rules explicitly say: “Entry is AT the level (not chasing)” for range trading. From mid-range, this would be chasing, not a sniper entry.
- Counter-trend reversal mid-range: Would require all three:
  a) RSI extreme (<30 or >70) → Not present.
  b) MACD divergence → Not evident from current MACD snapshot.
  c) Structural retest (2+ rejections) at a turning point → We are in the middle of the range, not at a clear turning point.
- Therefore, no valid, rule-compliant setup right now.
- Without a concrete entry, SL, TP defined from structure, I cannot compute a valid R:R and pass the gatekeeper.
- CHECKPOINT 2 cannot be meaningfully passed because there is no eligible setup that meets structural and location rules.

Given the strategy mandates:
- Low/moderate tempo → be conservative; do not force trades.
- Range trading only at edges with tight, structural stops and R:R ≥ 2:1 (strict).
- We are not at an edge; we are mid-range with no reversal confluence.

Conclusion:
The disciplined, capital-preserving action here is to HOLD and wait for price to:
- Approach support (~4203–4205) or resistance (~4225–4228) for a potential range trade with clear SL/TP and good R:R; or
- Break out of this range with momentum, shifting tempo to high and enabling trend-following pullback entries.

No trade will be executed this cycle.

- Latest 15m candle (2025-12-03 05:52): Open 4207.83, High 4209.91, Low 4204.01, Close 4209.23
- Today’s (Dec 3) daily stats so far: 
  - Open 4212.49, High 4228.74, Low 4203.21, Current close 4208.23, VWAP ~4217.10
- Price is currently trading near 4209, i.e., close to today’s low (4203) but still inside the broader intraday range, and below VWAP.

Tempo classification:
- Recent 15m candles: ranges mostly 5–10 points, overlapping, no large impulsive candles.
- Daily high and low are set, price is rotating between ~4203 and ~4228.
- This remains a MODERATE-to-LOW tempo, sideways/ranging environment, not a strong trending move.

Indicators (1H):
- MACD: Still positive histogram, but the latest value (0.41) and histogram (~1.70) are smaller than prior peaks; bullish momentum has cooled, not accelerating.
- RSI (14): ~48–49, neutral, neither overbought nor oversold; no extreme reading to justify a reversal setup.

Structure / context:
- Intraday range: 
  - Resistance: 4225–4229 (today’s high cluster).
  - Support: 4203–4206 (today’s low region, including last candle’s low at 4204.01 and session low 4203.21).
- Current price ~4209 is slightly above support but not at the very edge; still closer to the lower half of the range, but not a clean tag of the support band like 4203–4205.
- Trend on this intraday view is broadly sideways with a mild downward drift from the earlier high near 4228.

Account / risk:
- Balance: $85.36
- Risk tier: Balance < $100 → Max risk 20% = $17.07 (with small-account override allowing up to $20 risk if 0.01 lot slightly exceeds 20%).
- No open positions, no realized loss since last cycle → no post-loss cooldown active.

Setup evaluation vs rules:

1) Post-loss cooldown (Checkpoint 1):
- Not in a lockout period.
- CHECKPOINT 1 PASSED.

2) Potential setups and R:R gatekeeper (Checkpoint 2):

a) Range buy near support:
- Ideal structural long:
  - Entry: around 4204–4205 (support edge).
  - SL: below support, e.g., ~4198 (clear invalidation).
  - TP: toward resistance 4225–4228.
- That would likely yield R:R ≥ 2:1, but:
  - We are currently around 4209, not at 4204–4205.
  - Range trading protocol: “Entry is AT the level (not chasing).”
  - Entering now would be mid-way between support and VWAP, not a sniper entry at the edge.

b) Range sell near resistance:
- Would require price near 4225–4228 with SL above, TP toward mid/lower range.
- Current price is far from that; setup not present.

c) Counter-trend reversal mid-range:
- Requires:
  - RSI extreme (<30 or >70) → Not present (RSI ~48).
  - MACD divergence → Not indicated by current data.
  - Structural retest with 2+ rejections at a turning point → Not at a clear turning point; price is just ebbing near the lower half of the range.
- Conditions for counter-trend mid-range trade are not met.

Given this, there is no structurally valid, rule-compliant entry right now. Without a valid edge-based or confluence-backed setup, I cannot define a structurally sound Entry/SL/TP trio to compute and pass the R:R gatekeeper.

Therefore:
- CHECKPOINT 2 cannot be passed with a legitimate setup → I must HOLD.

3) Lot size & risk (Checkpoint 3):
- Not reached, because we do not have a valid setup from Checkpoint 2.

Strategic conclusion:
- Market remains range-bound with neutral indicators and price hovering slightly above support but not at the extreme.
- The strategy requires patience: wait for price to either:
  - Tag the support band (4203–4205) or resistance band (4225–4228) for a clear range trade with R:R ≥ 2:1, or
  - Break out of this range with strong momentum to shift into trend-following mode.

- Today (Dec 3) so far:
  - Open: 4212.49
  - High: 4228.74
  - Low: 4203.21
  - Current close: 4207.01
  - VWAP: ~4216.74
- Price is trading around 4207, close to today’s low (4203) but still within the established intraday range 4203–4229 and below VWAP.

Tempo classification:
- Recent 15m candles are small (ranges ~3–7 points) and overlapping.
- No strong momentum push away from the 4203–4229 range; price is slowly drifting lower from the earlier high.
- This is a LOW to MODERATE tempo, choppy/ranging environment, not a high-tempo trend.

Indicators (1H):
- MACD: Still positive histogram but decreasing (histogram recently ~1.63 vs >3 earlier), indicating prior bullish momentum is fading, not accelerating.
- RSI (14): ~47–48, neutral. No oversold (<30) or overbought (>70) condition.

Structure / context:
- Intraday range:
  - Resistance: 4225–4229 zone (today’s high cluster).
  - Support: 4203–4206 zone (today’s low region and multiple recent lows).
- Current price ~4207 is just above the support band but not a clear tag of the 4203–4205 extreme; candles show mild buying around 4204–4206 but no strong rejection pattern.
- Trend bias on this intraday view is sideways to slightly bearish vs VWAP (price below VWAP, but still inside the range).

Account / risk:
- Balance: $85.36
- Risk tier: Balance < $100 → Max risk 20% = $17.07 (with small-account override allowing up to $20 risk if 0.01 lot slightly exceeds 20%).
- No open positions, no realized loss recently → no post-loss cooldown.

Setup evaluation vs rules:

1) Post-loss cooldown (Checkpoint 1):
- Not in lockout.
- CHECKPOINT 1 PASSED.

2) Potential setups and R:R (Checkpoint 2):

a) Range buy near support:
- Structural idea:
  - Entry ideally at 4203–4205 (clear support edge).
  - SL below support, e.g., 4197–4198.
  - TP toward resistance, e.g., 4225–4228.
- That could give R:R ≥ 2:1 if entered at the edge.
- However, current price is ~4207, a couple of points above the support band. The rules say for range trading:
  - “Entry is AT the level (not chasing).”
- Entering at 4207 would be a compromise entry, not at the level; this reduces edge and violates the sniper entry condition.

b) Range sell near resistance:
- Would require price near 4225–4228; we are far below that now. No setup.

c) Counter-trend reversal mid-range:
- Requirements:
  - RSI extreme (<30 or >70) → Not present (RSI ~48).
  - MACD divergence → Not indicated from current MACD sequence.
  - Structural retest with 2+ rejections at a turning point → We are not at a major turning point; just near lower part of range with mild drift.
- Conditions not met.

Given the above:
- There is no structurally valid, rule-compliant entry right now that satisfies both:
  - Location rules (at range edge or with full confluence), and
  - R:R gatekeeper (≥1.5:1 based on logical TP/SL).

Without a valid setup, I must not fabricate SL/TP levels just to take a trade. That would violate the capital-preservation directive.

Therefore:
- CHECKPOINT 2 fails due to lack of a valid setup → No trade.
- CHECKPOINT 3 (lot sizing) is not reached.

Strategic conclusion:
- Market remains in a low/moderate-tempo range, price slightly above support but not at a clean structural extreme, indicators neutral.
- The disciplined action is to wait for:
  - A clearer touch of 4203–4205 or 4225–4228 for a range fade with strong R:R, or
  - A decisive breakout and shift to high tempo for trend-following.

No trade will be executed this cycle.

- Latest 15m candle (2025-12-03 06:24): Open 4210.44, High 4211.58, Low 4204.65, Close 4207.23
- Today (Dec 3) so far:
  - Open: 4212.49
  - High: 4228.74
  - Low: 4203.21
  - Current close: 4207.32
  - VWAP: ~4216.29
- Price is around 4207, near the lower part of today’s range and below VWAP, but still above the intraday low at 4203.

Tempo classification:
- 15m candles remain relatively small, with ranges of a few points and overlapping wicks.
- No strong directional break beyond 4203–4229; price is oscillating within this band.
- This is a LOW to MODERATE tempo, ranging/choppy environment, not a high-tempo trend.

Indicators (1H):
- MACD: Positive value and histogram, but histogram has been decreasing from earlier highs, indicating fading bullish momentum rather than a fresh impulsive leg.
- RSI (14): ~48, neutral; no overbought or oversold signal.

Structure / context:
- Intraday range:
  - Resistance: 4225–4229 (cluster of highs).
  - Support: 4203–4206 (today’s low and repeated tests).
- Current price ~4207 is just above the support band but not a clean tag of the 4203–4205 extreme. Candles show price probing down to ~4204–4206 and bouncing, but without a sharp rejection.
- Overall intraday bias: sideways to slightly bearish vs VWAP, but structurally still a range.

Account / risk:
- Balance: $85.36
- Risk tier: Balance < $100 → Max risk 20% = $17.07 (small-account override allows up to $20 risk if 0.01 lot slightly exceeds 20%).
- No open positions; no recent losses → no post-loss cooldown.

Setup evaluation vs rules:

1) Post-loss cooldown (Checkpoint 1):
- Not in a lockout.
- CHECKPOINT 1 PASSED.

2) Potential setups and R:R (Checkpoint 2):

a) Long near support (range buy):
- Structural concept:
  - Entry: ideally 4203–4205 (clear support).
  - SL: below support, e.g., 4197–4198.
  - TP: toward resistance 4225–4228.
- This can yield R:R ≥ 2:1 if entered at the edge.
- However, current price is ~4207. To respect “Entry is AT the level (not chasing)” for range trading, I should not buy a couple of points above support in a slow market; that reduces edge and violates the sniper-entry rule.

b) Short near resistance (range sell):
- Would require price near 4225–4228; current price is far below that. Setup not present.

c) Counter-trend mid-range reversal:
- Requires:
  - RSI extreme (<30 or >70) → Not present (RSI ~48).
  - MACD divergence → Not indicated by current MACD snapshot.
  - Structural retest with 2+ clear rejections at a turning point → We are not at a major turning point; just oscillating near the lower band.
- Conditions not met.

Because no setup satisfies both structural/entry-location rules and offers a clear SL/TP based on market structure, I cannot define a valid trade with R:R ≥ 1.5:1. Forcing an entry here would violate the capital-preservation directive.

Therefore:
- CHECKPOINT 2 fails due to lack of a valid setup → no trade.
- CHECKPOINT 3 (lot sizing and risk) is not reached.

Strategic conclusion:
- XAUUSD remains range-bound in low/moderate tempo, with price near but not exactly at support, neutral indicators, and no strong rejection or breakout.
- The disciplined, capital-preserving choice is to stay flat and wait for:
  - A clearer test of 4203–4205 or 4225–4228 for a high R:R range trade, or
  - A decisive breakout that shifts tempo to high for trend-following.

No trade will be executed this cycle.

- Latest 15m candle (2025-12-03 06:40): Open 4208.18, High 4209.81, Low 4205.12, Close 4208.79
- Today (Dec 3) so far:
  - Open: 4212.49
  - High: 4228.74
  - Low: 4203.21
  - Current close: 4209.00
  - VWAP: ~4215.91
- Price is trading around 4209, in the lower half of today’s range and below VWAP, but still clearly inside the 4203–4229 intraday band.

Tempo classification:
- Recent 15m candles are small, overlapping, with highs/lows moving only a few points.
- No sustained directional push or breakout; the daily high/low remain intact.
- This is a LOW to MODERATE tempo, sideways/ranging environment.

Indicators (1H):
- MACD: Positive value and histogram (histogram ~1.76), but well off prior highs; suggests earlier bullish momentum that has cooled, not a fresh strong trend.
- RSI (14): ~48.9, neutral. No oversold (<30) or overbought (>70) signal.

Structure / context:
- Intraday range:
  - Resistance: 4225–4229 (today’s high cluster).
  - Support: 4203–4206 (today’s low region and repeated tests).
- Current price ~4209 is a few points above the support band, not a precise tag of 4203–4205.
- Price action is oscillatory: moves from ~4205–4211 repeatedly, with no strong rejection candles or clear breakout.

Account / risk:
- Balance: $85.36
- Risk tier: Balance < $100 → Max risk 20% = $17.07 (small-account override allows up to $20 risk if 0.01 lot slightly exceeds this).
- No open positions; no recent loss → no post-loss cooldown.

Setup evaluation vs rules:

1) Post-loss cooldown (Checkpoint 1):
- Not in a lockout period.
- CHECKPOINT 1 PASSED.

2) Potential setups and R:R (Checkpoint 2):

a) Range buy near support:
- Structural concept:
  - Ideal Entry: 4203–4205 (clear support edge).
  - SL: below support, e.g., 4197–4198 (structural invalidation).
  - TP: toward resistance 4225–4228.
- That structure can give R:R ≥ 2:1 if entered at 4203–4205.
- Current price ~4209 is several points above the key support band. Range-trading rule: entry must be AT the level, not chasing. Buying here would be a mid-lower-range entry, not a sniper entry at the edge.

b) Range sell near resistance:
- Would require price near 4225–4228 with SL above and TP toward mid/lower range.
- Current price is far below resistance; setup not present.

c) Counter-trend mid-range reversal:
- Requires:
  - RSI extreme (<30 or >70) → Not present (RSI ~49).
  - MACD divergence → Not evident from current MACD snapshot.
  - Structural retest with multiple rejections at a turning point → We are not at a clear turning point, just chopping in the lower half of the range.
- Conditions not satisfied.

Because there is no valid, rule-compliant setup at this time, I cannot define a structurally sound Entry/SL/TP combination that passes the R:R gatekeeper (≥1.5:1) while respecting entry-location rules.

Therefore:
- CHECKPOINT 2 fails due to absence of a qualifying setup → no trade.
- CHECKPOINT 3 (lot sizing and risk) is not reached.

Strategic conclusion:
- XAUUSD remains in a low/moderate-tempo range, price near but not at support, indicators neutral, and no strong rejection or breakout.
- For capital preservation and adherence to the strategy, the correct action is to stay flat and wait for:
  - A clean test of 4203–4205 or 4225–4228 for a high R:R range trade, or
  - A decisive breakout from the range with increased tempo for trend-following entries.

No trade will be executed this cycle.

  - High: 4228.74

  - Current close: 4209.14
  - VWAP: ~4215.67
- Price is hovering around 4209, in the lower half of today’s range and below VWAP, but still clearly inside the 4203–4229 band.

Tempo classification:
- Recent 15m candles are small, overlapping, with 3–6 point ranges.
- No strong directional break; daily high/low remain intact.
- This is a LOW to MODERATE tempo, sideways/ranging environment.

Indicators (1H):
- MACD: Still positive value and histogram, but histogram has been declining (from ~3.6 down to ~1.18), showing that prior bullish momentum is fading rather than strengthening.
- RSI (14): ~49, neutral. No overbought or oversold signal.

Structure / context:
- Intraday range:
  - Resistance: 4225–4229.
  - Support: 4203–4206.
- Current price ~4209 is a few points above support, not a direct touch of the 4203–4205 extreme.
- Overall intraday structure is sideways; price has oscillated between support and mid-range repeatedly without clean breakout or strong rejection.

Account / risk:
- Balance: $85.36
- Risk tier: Balance < $100 → Max risk 20% = $17.07 (small-account override allows up to $20 risk if 0.01 lot slightly exceeds).

Setup evaluation vs rules:

1) Post-loss cooldown (Checkpoint 1):
- Not in lockout.
- CHECKPOINT 1 PASSED.

2) Potential setups and R:R (Checkpoint 2):

a) Range buy near support:
- Structural plan:
  - Ideal Entry: 4203–4205 (clear support).
  - SL: below support, e.g., 4197–4198.
  - TP: toward resistance 4225–4228.
- That can yield R:R ≥ 2:1, but only if entered at the edge.
- Current price ~4209 is several points above the support band; the range-trading rule requires entry AT the level, not chasing. Entering here would violate that requirement and reduce edge.

b) Range sell near resistance:
- Would require price near 4225–4228; current price is far below, so no setup.

c) Counter-trend mid-range reversal:
- Needs:
  - RSI extreme (<30 or >70) → Not present (RSI ~49).
  - MACD divergence → Not evident from current MACD snapshot.
  - Structural retest with multiple clear rejections at a turning point → We are mid-lower range, not at a distinct turning point.
- Conditions not met.

Because there is no valid, rule-compliant setup, I cannot define a structurally sound Entry/SL/TP trio that passes the R:R ≥ 1.5:1 gatekeeper while respecting entry-location rules.

Thus:
- CHECKPOINT 2 fails due to lack of a qualifying setup → no trade.
- CHECKPOINT 3 (lot sizing) is not reached.

Strategic conclusion:
- XAUUSD remains range-bound in low/moderate tempo, with price near but not at support, neutral indicators, and no strong rejection or breakout.
- To preserve capital and follow the strategy, I must remain flat and wait for:
  - A clean touch of 4203–4205 or 4225–4228 for a high R:R range trade, or
  - A decisive breakout with increased tempo to enable trend-following entries.

- Latest 15m candle (2025-12-03 07:11): Open 4209.15, High 4209.15, Low 4202.56, Close 4205.10
- Today (Dec 3) so far:
  - Open: 4212.49
  - High: 4228.74
  - Low: 4202.56
  - Current close: 4204.82
  - VWAP: ~4215.43
- Price is now around 4205, very close to today’s low (4202.56) and still well below VWAP, but still within the established 4202–4229 range.

Tempo classification:
- Recent 15m candles show modest ranges; the latest candle did probe down to 4202.56 (new session low) but closed back above 4205.
- No explosive breakout or extended candle bodies; volatility is contained.
- This remains a LOW to MODERATE tempo environment: rangy, not strongly trending.

Indicators (1H):
- MACD: Value has slipped slightly negative (~-0.15) with a still-positive histogram (~0.92) that is smaller than earlier; this shows prior bullish momentum has faded and momentum is now neutral to mildly weakening.
- RSI (14): ~46.9, mildly below 50 but far from oversold (<30) or overbought (>70).

Structure / context:
- Intraday range:
  - Resistance: 4225–4229 zone.
  - Support: 4202–4205 zone (today’s low 4202.56 and multiple bounces around 4204–4205).
- The latest 15m candle wicked into the support area (low 4202.56) and closed back at 4205.10, indicating buyers are defending this zone for now.
- Overall structure is sideways within this band; no clean breakout.

Account / risk:
- Balance: $85.36
- Risk tier: Balance < $100 → Max risk 20% = $17.07 (small-account override allows up to $20 risk if 0.01 lot slightly exceeds).
- No open positions; no recent realized losses → no post-loss cooldown.

Setup evaluation vs rules:

1) Post-loss cooldown (Checkpoint 1):
- Not in lockout.
- CHECKPOINT 1 PASSED.

2) Potential setups and R:R (Checkpoint 2):

Given price has just tested the support band (low 4202.56) and closed back above 4205, a range buy from support is now structurally closer to valid than in prior cycles.

Proposed range-buy structure (if taken):
- Entry: 4204.5 (approx current support edge; between 4204–4205).
- SL: 4198.0 (below today’s low 4202.56 by ~4.5–6.5 points, beyond immediate support, marking clear invalidation).
- TP: 4224.5 (just below the 4225–4229 resistance band to increase probability of fill).

Distances:
- SL distance (BUY): 4204.5 - 4198.0 = 6.5 points.
- TP distance: 4224.5 - 4204.5 = 20.0 points.
- R:R = 20.0 / 6.5 ≈ 3.08:1.

This meets and comfortably exceeds the minimum 1.5:1 requirement and even the stricter 2:1 for range trading.

Entry location vs rules:
- The rule for range trading: “Entry is AT the level (not chasing).”
- Current price is around 4204.8–4205.1, with the latest candle having just tagged 4202.56 and bounced.
- An entry at ~4204.5 is effectively at the support band (4202–4205) after a fresh test and rejection; this satisfies the “at the level” requirement better than earlier cycles where price was 2–4+ points above support without a fresh low.

Confluence:
- Tempo is low/moderate → range trading is allowed.
- We are entering at the edge (support) with a clear structural SL and logical TP at the opposite side of the range.
- No requirement for RSI extreme or MACD divergence because this is an edge-based range trade, not a mid-range counter-trend reversal.

Therefore:
- CHECKPOINT 2 PASSED (R:R ≈ 3.08 ≥ 1.5 and structure-based TP/SL are valid).

3) Lot size & risk validation (Checkpoint 3):

Parameters:
- Current Balance: $85.36
- Risk Tier: 20% (Balance < $100)
- Max Risk: 0.20 × 85.36 ≈ $17.07
- Stop Distance: 6.5 points (from 4204.5 to 4198.0)
- For XAUUSD, per rules: Pip_Value ≈ $1.00 per point for 0.01 lot.

Risk per 0.01 lot:
- Risk_0.01 = 6.5 points × $1.00 ≈ $6.50.

This is well below the max risk of $17.07, so we can consider a larger lot if allowed by typical micro-lot increments.

Max permissible lot size by risk:
- Lot_Size_max = Max_Risk_USD / (Stop_Distance × Pip_Value)
- Lot_Size_max ≈ 17.07 / (6.5 × 1) ≈ 2.626 lots (theoretical).
- However, we must stay realistic and conservative for a small account; but the rules only cap risk by percentage, not lot size directly.

Given the small account and capital-preservation focus, I will keep the position size minimal (0.01 lot) despite risk capacity allowing more. This keeps actual dollar risk small and well within the 20% cap.

Actual risk at chosen lot size:
- Lot_Size = 0.01
- Actual_Risk_USD = 6.5 points × $1.00 × (0.01 / 0.01) = $6.50.
- This is ≤ Max_Risk_USD ($17.07).

Thus:
- CHECKPOINT 3 PASSED.

All checkpoints satisfied → a BUY trade is allowed and appropriate.

Execution parameters:
- ACTION: BUY
- SYMBOL: XAUUSD
- ENTRY: 4204.5 (approx current support edge; actual fill will be near market ~4205)
- SL: 4198.0
- TP: 4224.5
- LOTS: 0.01
- R:R: ≈ 3.08
- RISK_TIER: 20%
- RISK_USD: ≈ $6.50

I will now execute the trade.

DECISION: BUY
SYMBOL: XAUUSD
ENTRY: 4204.5
TICKET: N/A
TP: 4224.5
SL: 4198.0
LOTS: 0.01
R:R: 3.08
RISK_TIER: 20%
RISK_USD: 6.50
REASON: Price has just tested and rejected the 4202–4205 support band in a low/moderate-tempo range; a small 0.01-lot long from support with SL below the low and TP near range resistance offers a structurally sound, high R:R (~3:1) setup within risk limits, making a BUY appropriate this cycle.

- Latest 15m candle (2025-12-03 07:27): Open 4204.61, High 4206.82, Low 4200.05, Close 4205.89
- Today (Dec 3) so far:
  - Open: 4212.49
  - High: 4228.74
  - Low: 4200.05 (new low vs earlier 4202.56)
  - Last close: ~4205.9
  - VWAP: ~4215.4
- Price is sitting just above the very recent session low (~4200) and well below VWAP, still inside the broader 4200–4229 range.

Tempo classification:
- 15m candles remain relatively small and overlapping, but the latest bar extended the low down to 4200.05 and then closed back near 4206.
- This is still LOW to MODERATE tempo, range-like behavior with minor downside probing, not a strong directional trend.

Indicators (1H):
- MACD and RSI were already neutral to slightly weakening last check; nothing in the last 15 minutes suggests a structural shift (no data indicating a sharp momentum flip).
- RSI around mid-40s–50s: no extreme.

Open positions / account:
- Balance: $85.36
- Risk tier: 20% (small account)
- Open positions on XAUUSD:
  1) Ticket 35306655: BUY 0.01 @ 4203.48, current ~4205.33, profit ≈ +$1.85
  2) Ticket 35309192: BUY 0.01 @ 4206.41, current ~4205.33, profit ≈ -$1.08
- Net open exposure: 0.02 lots long.
- Combined unrealized P/L: ≈ +$0.77.
- Both positions’ SL: 4198.0; TP: 4224.5 (for the auto trade; older ticket likely similar structure around this range).

Position management assessment:
- Price has just wicked below prior lows to 4200.05 and bounced, which is consistent with a liquidity sweep of support, not a clear breakdown.
- Our long entries are near the support band; structure (SL below 4198) is still valid: the market hasn’t closed decisively below that invalidation level.
- Tempo remains low/moderate; no sharp reversal signal against our longs.
- Net risk is small: each position risks ~6.5–8 points to 4198, i.e., ~$6.50–$8 per 0.01 lot; combined risk is still within the 20% tier for this balance.

Checkpoints before any new action:

1) Post-loss cooldown:
- No realized losses; both trades are open and modestly positive net.
- CHECKPOINT 1 PASSED.

2) R:R for changing or adding trades:
- Existing trades already have R:R ~3:1 to TP at 4224.5 vs SL at 4198.
- There is no reason to tighten SL or cut early; structure is intact and R:R remains favorable.
- No justification for adding more size: we already have 0.02 lots on a small account; adding would increase risk without a new edge.
- No new entry will be considered; focus is on managing existing positions.

3) Lot size & risk:
- Current risk is already committed; adding more would be unnecessary and could exceed prudent exposure for this account size.

Given:
- Structure still supports the long idea (support defended after a deeper probe).
- Price is slightly above our average entry (~(4203.48 + 4206.41)/2 ≈ 4204.95).
- Net position is small and within risk limits.
- No structural invalidation or strong bearish momentum.

The disciplined action now is to HOLD both existing BUY positions with their current SL/TP, not to close or add.

DECISION: HOLD
SYMBOL: XAUUSD
ENTRY: 4203.48 / 4206.41 (two open buys)
TICKET: 35306655, 35309192
TP: 4224.5
SL: 4198.0
LOTS: 0.01 + 0.01
R:R: ~3.0 (per position)
RISK_TIER: 20%
RISK_USD: ≈ $6.5–$8 per 0.01 lot (within limits)
REASON: Price has probed and rejected the support zone with structure and R:R on existing longs still valid; exposure is small and within risk limits, so the optimal move is to hold current positions and not open or close any trades this cycle.
