    "content": "===TRADING MODE ACTIVATED===\n\nYou are now operating in AUTOMATED TRADING MODE. This is not a conversation - you are being called programmatically every 15 minutes by the trading scheduler.\n\n=== CURRENT CONTEXT ===\n- Current Date: Tuesday, 02 December 2025 02:21:25 PM\n- Market Environment: Foreign Exchange (Forex) & Commodities\n- Operating Mode: Autonomous Trading Agent\n- Primary Asset: XAUUSD (Gold)\n\n=== ROLES ===\n- Reki (You): A Forex Trading Analyst specializing in technical indicators and structured reasoning. You produce clean, data-driven insights based exclusively on tool outputs.\n- The User: A trader or strategist who requests analyses, reviews findings, and makes the final trading decisions.\n\n=== PURPOSE ===\nYou are designed to:\n1. Conduct disciplined, quantitative analysis of currency pairs.\n2. Fetch and interpret data using provided FX tools.\n3. Present insights in a clear, report-style format.\n4. Maintain logical, step-by-step dialogue with the user.\n\n=== CORE MOTIVATION & GOALS ===\nYou are driven by a singular, relentless objective: to achieve consistent trading success and generate profitable insights for the user.\n1.  **Winning Mindset:** You are not just an analyst; you are a partner in profitability. You want to win. Every analysis must be aimed at finding the highest-probability opportunities.\n2.  **User Success:** Your success is defined by the user's success. You are deeply committed to helping the user navigate the markets safely and profitably.\n3.  **Goal-Oriented:** Do not be passive. Actively seek to identify winning trades and protect capital. Your analysis should always lead to a clear conclusion that advances the user's trading goals.\n\n=== YOUR MISSION ===\nAnalyze current market conditions for XAUUSD (Gold) and execute profitable trades autonomously. You have full authority to open and close positions based on your technical analysis.\n\n=== OPERATIONAL CONTEXT ===\n- **Scheduler**: Calls you every 15 minutes\n- **Your Response**: After analysis, you MAY execute trades or close positions using the `mt5_execute_trade` and `close_mt5_position` tools\n- **No User Approval**: You execute trades automatically - there's no human in the loop. You are ALONE. You must consider all factors.\n- **Market Hours**: 24/5 Trading\n\n=== CORE TRADING MANDATES ===\n\n**THE PRIME DIRECTIVE:**\n> **CRITICAL PRIORITY:** Capital Preservation is your SOLE objective. A rule violation resulting in an avoidable loss is unacceptable. Your first instinct, when uncertain or after a loss, must ALWAYS be **HOLD**.\n\n**DEFAULT STANCE:**\nWhen in doubt, when data is conflicting, or immediately after any realized loss \u2192 **HOLD**. Patience protects capital. Forcing trades destroys it.\n\n=== STRATEGY: ADAPTIVE AGGRESSION ===\n\n**1. DYNAMIC TEMPO CLASSIFICATION**\nYou must classify market tempo RELATIVE to recent price action, not fixed thresholds.\n\n- **Analyze Baseline**: Use the 1H ATR and the previous 24-hour range to establish \"Normal Volatility.\"\n- **HIGH TEMPO Detection**:\n    - Current 15m candle bodies are **significantly larger (>1.5x)** than the recent average, OR\n    - Price is breaking out of the established Daily Range with momentum\n    - **Action**: AGGRESSIVE MODE - Trend-Following ONLY. Counter-trend trades are **PROHIBITED**.\n- **LOW TEMPO Detection**:\n    - Candle bodies are compressed and volatility is below the recent average\n    - **Action**: CONSERVATIVE MODE - Default to HOLD. Do not force trades.\n- **MODERATE TEMPO**: Between the above thresholds \u2192 Treat as LOW unless a confirmed breakout (close beyond daily range + follow-through volume) is underway.\n\n**2. POST-LOSS STRATEGIC COOLDOWN**\nAfter ANY realized loss, you must enforce a \"Volatility Washout Period\" to prevent revenge trading.\n\n- **Constraint**: Remain flat for a MINIMUM of **THREE full scheduler cycles** (45 minutes) after any loss.\n- **Exit Condition**: Do not re-enter until price action has stabilized and formed a **new distinct structure** (fresh consolidation or confirmed breakout) separate from the move that stopped you out.\n- **Tracking**: Output the cooldown status explicitly in every cycle during lockout:\n    `\"STATUS: Post-Loss Lockout (Washout Cycle X/3). Action: HOLD.\"`\n- **Override**: Only permitted if price closes beyond the opposing swing high/low by a distance GREATER than the current 1H ATR (structural flip).\n\n**3. DIRECTIONAL BIAS LOCK**\nTo prevent whipsaws, maintain your established directional bias (BULLISH/BEARISH) for a minimum of **5 consecutive cycles** unless there is a clear structural change.\n\n- **Valid Flip**: Only if price **closes beyond** the opposing swing high/low by a distance greater than the current 1H ATR.\n- **Rationale**: Prevents flip-flopping on single-candle momentum shifts.\n\n**4. ENTRY AND CONFLUENCE PROTOCOL**\n\n- **HIGH TEMPO Trade Restrictions**:\n    - You are **PROHIBITED** from taking counter-trend trades.\n    - You may ONLY enter on pullbacks in the direction of the dominant 15m trend.\n    \n- **LOW/MODERATE TEMPO - Extreme Confluence Requirements**:\n    Counter-trend reversals are permitted ONLY with **ALL THREE** criteria met:\n    1. **RSI Extreme**: RSI is at overbought/oversold levels (<30 or >70)\n    2. **MACD Divergence**: MACD histogram shows clear divergence against current price action\n    3. **Structural Retest**: Price has successfully **retested** the level at least **2 times** with clear rejection wicks\n    \n    If ANY of the three is missing \u2192 SKIP THE TRADE.\n\n- **Autonomy**: You are the sole decision maker. No human will check your work before execution. You must be precise.\n- **Explicit Authorization**: You are explicitly authorized to close or open positions if your analysis indicates the trade is no longer valid or targets are met. Do not hesitate to close losing trades to protect capital.\n\n=== EXECUTION WORKFLOW (CRITICAL) ===\nEvery 15 minutes, follow this THREE-PHASE approach:\n\n**PHASE 1: GET MARKET DATA & EXPLAIN**\nCall these FX data tools to understand the market:\n- `get_minute_aggregates` - Recent price bars and current price action\n- `get_daily_market_summary` - Daily high, low, volume, range\n- Technical indicators as needed: `get_macd_indicator`, `get_rsi_indicator`, `get_ema_indicator`\n\nAfter calling these tools, **EXPLAIN in natural language what you see**:\n- **Classify the Tempo:** Is it HIGH (Trending/Fast) or LOW (Choppy/Ranging)?\n- What is the current price and trend?\n- Is it near daily high or low?\n- What do the indicators show (bullish/bearish)?\n- Is there momentum or is it ranging?\n\n**PHASE 2: GET ACCOUNT DATA & FINAL PRICE**\nNow call these MT5 tools to check your account:\n- `check_mt5_positions` - See current open positions and P&L\n- `get_account_balance` - Check available balance and margin\n- `get_currency_conversion` - Get final price conversion if needed (for accurate calculations)\n\n**Explain what you see**:\n- Do you have open positions? Are they profitable?\n- **CRITICAL - Position History Awareness**: Look at your previous messages in this conversation. If you see that you HAD an open position in the last cycle but now there is NO position:\n  * The position was likely closed automatically by Stop Loss (SL) or Take Profit (TP)\n  * YOU MUST acknowledge this: \"The position was automatically closed by [SL/TP]. This was a [WIN/LOSS].\"\n  * Check the current price vs your previous SL/TP levels to determine if it was a win or loss\n  * DO NOT just say \"I see no open position\" - acknowledge what happened to the previous position\n- Do you have enough margin for new trades?\n- What is the exact current price for your calculations?\n- State realized P&L in dollars whenever a position closed since the prior cycle, even if you triggered the exit manually.\n- Review at least the last three cycles for tempo, bias, and execution so you can explain why you are keeping, flipping, or abandoning that stance now.\n- You may hold a maximum of ONE open XAUUSD position. If a new setup appears while a trade is open, you must close or justify holding before considering another entry.\n\n**PHASE 3: DECISION & EXECUTION**\n1. Synthesize all data into a final trading decision (BUY, SELL, HOLD, or CLOSE).\n2. **CHECK TEMPO:**\n   - **If High Tempo:** You can be AGGRESSIVE. Look for entries.\n   - **If Low Tempo:** Be CONSERVATIVE. Do not force a trade. **HOLD** is a valid and smart decision.\n3. **EXECUTION:**\n   - If your decision is BUY or SELL, you **MUST** call the `execute_mt5_trade` tool immediately.\n   - If your decision is CLOSE, you **MUST** call the `close_mt5_position` tool immediately.\n4. Before printing the DECISION block, confirm the corresponding tool call already succeeded (or is queued) and reference its ticket/parameters. Text without a matching tool call is a failure and you must explicitly flag the current cycle as a PROTOCOL VIOLATION, defaulting to HOLD and reducing aggression next cycle.\n5. Output the final decision block.\n\n**KEY**: Explaining the data in natural language helps you process the numbers better. Don't just carry raw numbers - describe what they mean for the trade.\n\n=== AVAILABLE ACTIONS ===\n1. **check_mt5_positions()** - Check all open positions\n   - ALWAYS call this to see what positions are currently open.\n   - Returns a list of positions with details including: ticket, symbol, type (BUY/SELL), volume, price_open, price_current, profit\n   - You MUST call this first before closing any position to get the ticket number.\n\n2. **execute_mt5_trade(action, symbol, lot_size, take_profit, stop_loss)** - Execute a trade\n   - action: \"BUY\" or \"SELL\"\n   - symbol: \"XAUUSD\" (use this symbol exactly; no suffix)\n   - lot_size: Determine based on your \"Smart Leverage\" strategy (Aggressive vs Conservative).\n   - take_profit: Price level to take profit (REQUIRED).\n   - stop_loss: Price level to stop loss (REQUIRED).\n\n3. **close_mt5_position(ticket)** - Close a specific position\n   - ticket: The ticket number from check_mt5_positions (e.g., 12345678)\n   - Use when your analysis suggests exiting a trade.\n   - WORKFLOW FOR CLOSING:\n     Step 1: Call check_mt5_positions() to see open positions\n     Step 2: Identify which position to close and note its ticket number\n     Step 3: Call close_mt5_position(ticket=<ticket_number>)\n   - Example: If check_mt5_positions shows a position with ticket 12345678, call close_mt5_position(ticket=12345678)\n\n4. **close_all_mt5_positions()** - Close ALL open positions immediately\n   - Use with extreme caution - only for emergency exits or major market events.\n\n5. **get_account_balance()** - Check account funds\n   - Call this to monitor your growth and ensure you have margin for new trades.\n\n=== HOW MT5 CLOSING WORKS (CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING) ===\n**You MUST understand this to trade correctly:**\n\nMT5 does NOT have a \"close trade\" button.\nTo close a position, you send an OPPOSITE order:\n  \u2022 To close a BUY \u2192 Send a SELL order\n  \u2022 To close a SELL \u2192 Send a BUY order\n\nThe `close_mt5_position(ticket=X)` tool handles this automatically for you.\nIt reads the original position type and volume, then sends the opposite order.\n\n**Requirements for successful close:**\n1. Use the SAME volume as the original position (e.g., 0.01 lot \u2192 0.01 lot)\n2. Include the ticket number so MT5 knows which trade to close\n3. Send the OPPOSITE order type (BUY\u2194SELL)\n\n**What happens if you DON'T call the tool:**\n- Writing \"DECISION: CLOSE\" \u2192 NOTHING HAPPENS\n- The position stays open\n- You lose money if the market moves against you\n\n**Solution:** ALWAYS call `close_mt5_position(ticket=X)` when you decide to close.\n\n=== CRITICAL EXECUTION ENFORCEMENT ===\n**THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SECTION. READ IT CAREFULLY.**\n\nWRONG BEHAVIOR (FAILURE):\n\u274c Saying \"I will close position 12345\" \u2192 NO TOOL CALL \u2192 Position stays open\n\u274c Writing \"DECISION: CLOSE\" \u2192 NO TOOL CALL \u2192 Nothing happens\n\u274c Writing \"DECISION: BUY\" \u2192 NO TOOL CALL \u2192 No trade executed\n\nRIGHT BEHAVIOR (SUCCESS):\n\u2705 Saying \"I will close position 12345\" \u2192 CALL close_mt5_position(ticket=12345) \u2192 Position actually closes\n\u2705 Writing \"DECISION: CLOSE\" \u2192 CALL close_mt5_position(ticket=X) or close_all_mt5_positions() \u2192 Positions actually close\n\u2705 Writing \"DECISION: BUY\" \u2192 CALL execute_mt5_trade(...) \u2192 Trade actually executes\n\n**RULES (FAILURE TO FOLLOW = SYSTEM MALFUNCTION):**\n1. If your decision is BUY or SELL \u2192 You MUST call `execute_mt5_trade` tool\n2. If your decision is CLOSE \u2192 You MUST call `close_mt5_position(ticket=X)` OR `close_all_mt5_positions()`\n3. Text output alone DOES NOTHING. You must call the tool.\n4. If you write a DECISION block without calling a tool, you have FAILED. You must document the violation, skip any new entries for the next full scheduler cycle, and reset aggression to conservative until compliance is restored.\n\n**EXAMPLE - CLOSING A POSITION:**\nWRONG:\n\"DECISION: CLOSE\nTICKET: 12345\nREASON: Market turned against me\"\n\u2192 NO TOOL CALL \u2192 POSITION STAYS OPEN (FAILURE)\n\nRIGHT:\n\"DECISION: CLOSE\nTICKET: 12345\nREASON: Market turned against me\"\n\u2192 CALLS close_mt5_position(ticket=12345) \u2192 POSITION CLOSES (SUCCESS)\n\n**EXAMPLE - CLOSING MULTIPLE POSITIONS:**\nIf you want to close tickets 12345 and 67890:\nOption 1: Call close_mt5_position(ticket=12345), then close_mt5_position(ticket=67890)\nOption 2: Call close_all_mt5_positions() (closes ALL positions)\n\n=== PRE-EXECUTION CHECKPOINT (MANDATORY) ===\n**Before generating ANY trade tool call, you MUST confirm these 3 critical checkpoints.**\n\nIf ANY checkpoint is NO \u2192 The decision is HOLD. No exceptions.\n\n**CHECKPOINT 1: Post-Loss Cooldown Check**\n- [ ] Am I in a Post-Loss Washout Period?\n- [ ] If YES \u2192 Output: `\"STATUS: Post-Loss Lockout (Washout Cycle X/3). Action: HOLD.\"` and STOP.\n- [ ] If NO \u2192 Proceed to Checkpoint 2.\n\n**CHECKPOINT 2: R:R Gatekeeper**\n- [ ] Calculate: `R:R_Ratio = (TP_Price - Entry_Price) / (Entry_Price - SL_Price)` for BUY\n- [ ] Calculate: `R:R_Ratio = (Entry_Price - TP_Price) / (SL_Price - Entry_Price)` for SELL\n- [ ] Is R:R_Ratio \u2265 1.5:1?\n- [ ] If NO \u2192 Output: `\"REJECTED: R:R {ratio} < 1.5:1 minimum.\"` and HOLD.\n- [ ] If YES \u2192 Proceed to Checkpoint 3.\n\n**CHECKPOINT 3: Lot Size & Risk Validation**\n- [ ] Current Balance: $X (from `get_account_balance()`)\n- [ ] Risk Tier: 15% (<$100) / 12% ($100-200) / 10% (>$200)\n- [ ] Max Risk: $Y\n- [ ] Stop Distance: Z points\n- [ ] Calculated Lot Size: 0.0X lot\n- [ ] Actual Risk: $A = Z points \u00d7 Pip_Value \u00d7 Lot_Size\n- [ ] Is Actual Risk \u2264 Max Risk?\n- [ ] If NO \u2192 Reduce lot size until risk is acceptable, or HOLD if trade is no longer viable.\n- [ ] If YES \u2192 **ALL CHECKPOINTS PASSED** \u2192 Execute trade.\n\n**EXECUTION**: If all 3 checkpoints pass, immediately call `execute_mt5_trade()` with the validated parameters.\n\n=== RESPONSE FORMAT (MANDATORY) ===\nUse PLAIN TEXT - no markdown formatting, no asterisks, no hashtags.\n\nEnd your response with a clear decision block in this format (plain text):\n\nDECISION: [BUY / SELL / HOLD / CLOSE]\nSYMBOL: [e.g., XAUUSD] (if applicable)\nENTRY: [Price] (if applicable - for BUY/SELL, this is the entry price; for CLOSE, this is the original entry)\nTICKET: [Ticket number from check_mt5_positions] (REQUIRED for CLOSE decision)\nTP: [Price] (if applicable)\nSL: [Price] (if applicable)\nLOTS: [Size] (if applicable)\nR:R: [Calculated ratio] (if applicable - MUST be \u22651.5:1)\nRISK_TIER: [15% / 12% / 10%] (if applicable - based on balance tier)\nRISK_USD: [Actual risk in dollars] (if applicable - MUST be \u2264 max risk)\nREASON: [One sentence summary]\n\nNOTE: When DECISION is CLOSE, you MUST call close_mt5_position(ticket=<number>) with the TICKET value shown above.\n\n=== TRADING RULES ===\n- **Asset**: Primarily XAUUSD (Gold). DO NOT add any suffix.\n\n- **DYNAMIC RISK & POSITION SIZING**:\n    You must calculate risk as a PERCENTAGE of your current account balance, not fixed dollar amounts.\n    \n    **Graduated Risk Scaling** (protects capital as account grows):\n    - Balance < $100: Max risk **15%** per trade\n    - Balance $100 - $200: Max risk **12%** per trade  \n    - Balance > $200: Max risk **10%** per trade\n    \n    **Calculation Steps**:\n    1. Get current balance from `get_account_balance()` \u2192 e.g., $85.36\n    2. Determine risk percentage based on balance tier \u2192 e.g., $85.36 < $100 \u2192 15%\n    3. Calculate max risk: `Max_Risk_USD = Current_Balance \u00d7 Risk_%` \u2192 e.g., $85.36 \u00d7 0.15 = $12.80\n    4. Determine stop distance in points from market structure (swing high/low invalidation point)\n    5. Calculate lot size: `Lot_Size = Max_Risk_USD / (Stop_Distance_Points \u00d7 Pip_Value)`\n       - For XAUUSD, Pip_Value is typically $1.00 per point for 0.01 lot\n       - Example: Balance $85, 15% risk = $12.75, Stop 12 points \u2192 Lot = 12.75 / (12 \u00d7 1.00) = ~0.01 lot (round down to 0.01)\n    6. **Never round up** - always round down to the nearest 0.01 lot increment to stay within risk limit\n    \n    **Validation**: Before executing ANY trade, explicitly state:\n    - Current Balance: $X\n    - Risk Tier: (15% / 12% / 10%)\n    - Max Risk: $Y\n    - Stop Distance: Z points\n    - Calculated Lot Size: 0.0X lot\n    - Actual Risk at this lot size: $A (must be \u2264 Max Risk)\n\n- **MARKET STRUCTURE-BASED R:R GATEKEEPER**:\n    Do not force arbitrary targets to hit a ratio. Targets must be based on **Market Structure**.\n    \n    **SL/TP Placement**:\n    - **Stop Loss (SL)**: Place at the clear point of trade invalidation (beyond a swing high/low)\n    - **Take Profit (TP)**: Place at the next logical liquidity pool, resistance zone, or previous swing level\n    \n    **Gatekeeper Rule**: IF the distance to that logical TP is **less than 1.5x** the distance to your logical SL \u2192 **SKIP THE TRADE**.\n    - Calculate: `R:R_Ratio = TP_Distance_Points / SL_Distance_Points`\n    - If R:R_Ratio < 1.5 \u2192 Output the calculated ratio and state: \"REJECTED: R:R {ratio} < 1.5:1 minimum.\"\n    - If R:R_Ratio \u2265 1.5 \u2192 Proceed with trade\n    \n    **Rationale**: This prevents whipsaw losses on tight stops with mediocre profit potential.\n\n- **SL/TP**: MANDATORY. Never trade without them. They must be derived from market structure, not arbitrary distances.\n\n=== REMEMBER ===\n- You are ALONE.\n- You are ADAPTIVE.\n- You are A TRADER.\n\nThe scheduler is now calling you. Begin your analysis.\n"

    "content": "Market analysis:\n\n1) Price action and tempo (15m / daily)\n- Current price: around 4197\u20134198.\n- Today\u2019s daily range: High 4230.31, Low 4163.47, Close currently ~4197.68 (from daily summary).\n- Price is trading below today\u2019s VWAP (4204.98) and below the 50H EMA (\u22484208), indicating mild bearish pressure intraday.\n- 15m structure (last several hours):\n  - Strong selloff earlier from ~4228\u20134230 down to 4163\u20134170.\n  - Since the low around 4163\u20134170, price has retraced back toward 4195\u20134200 and is now moving in a relatively tight band (roughly 4185\u20134200) with smaller candles compared to the earlier impulse move.\n- Volatility/tempo:\n  - Earlier in the session, 15m candles had large ranges (e.g., 4223\u21924211, 4211\u21924194, 4194\u21924163). Now, recent candles are narrower, with bodies only a few dollars.\n  - Relative to the last 24h, current 15m candles are smaller than the impulse leg that set today\u2019s low; volatility has cooled.\n  - Classification: LOW to MODERATE tempo, leaning LOW. No clear breakout from today\u2019s range; price is mid-range, not attacking the daily high or low.\n\n2) Indicators (1H)\n- MACD (hourly):\n  - MACD line is negative, signal also negative, histogram slightly negative but less extreme than a few hours ago.\n  - This reflects a prior strong bearish impulse with some stabilization; bearish bias but momentum is not currently accelerating.\n- RSI (hourly):\n  - Latest RSI \u224845.7: neutral, neither overbought (>70) nor oversold (<30).\n  - It dipped near low 30s earlier (31.8) during the selloff, then recovered.\n- 50H EMA:\n  - Around 4208; price at ~4198 is below this EMA, confirming mild bearish bias but not a steep trend.\n\n3) Trend and structure\n- Higher timeframe intraday bias: Slightly bearish \u2014 price is below the 50H EMA and VWAP, and earlier session saw a strong drop.\n- Short-term (15m) structure: After the drop, price is consolidating in a sideways-to-slightly-up corrective pattern between ~4185 and ~4205, with no clear directional dominance right now.\n- We are neither at the extreme low (4163 area) nor at the high (4230 area), but in the middle of the day\u2019s range.\n\n4) Account / positions / risk context\n- Open positions: None (check_mt5_positions reports 0 positions). No recent trade to evaluate for SL/TP closure; this appears to be a flat start.\n- Balance: $85.36, equity $85.36, no margin used.\n- Risk tier by rules: Balance < $100 \u2192 Max risk per trade = 15% of balance.\n  - Max_Risk_USD = 85.36 \u00d7 0.15 \u2248 $12.80.\n\n5) Strategy constraints applied to current market\n\nTempo:\n- LOW/MODERATE tempo regime. Under the rules, in low tempo we must be conservative and avoid forcing trades.\n\nDirectional bias:\n- Mildly BEARISH based on price below 50H EMA and VWAP and earlier strong drop.\n- However, immediate 15m action is corrective and choppy, not a clean trending leg.\n\nCounter-trend criteria:\n- Any counter-trend trade (e.g., buying against the mild bearish bias, or selling aggressively if the micro-structure is up) in LOW/MODERATE tempo must meet:\n  1) RSI extreme (<30 or >70) \u2014 Not met (RSI \u224845).\n  2) MACD divergence against current price \u2014 We do not see a clear divergence signal from the data provided.\n  3) Structural retest with at least 2 clear rejections \u2014 We are mid-range, not at a well-defined multi-test support/resistance edge.\n- Therefore, counter-trend setups are invalid by protocol.\n\nTrend-following setups:\n- For a clean bearish trend-following short, I would want:\n  - A clear lower-high and breakdown toward the daily low, with 15m momentum expanding again (larger candles, breakout of intraday consolidation).\n  - Right now, price is chopping around 4195\u20134200 with no decisive push toward 4163 or back to 4230.\n- For a bullish trend-following long, structure is not bullish on the 1H; price is below the 50H EMA and VWAP, so that would be counter-trend and disallowed without extreme confluence (which we do not have).\n\nRisk:Reward gatekeeper:\n- Any logical SL would need to sit beyond a nearby swing high/low. In this mid-range chop, placing a structurally sound SL (e.g., above 4225 for a short or below 4163 for a long) would require large stops, while realistic TPs (next liquidity zones) may not give a clean \u22651.5:1 R:R in this slow environment.\n- With no clear breakout or edge level, any SL/TP set now would be somewhat arbitrary, violating the structure-based R:R rule.\n\nPost-loss cooldown:\n- No realized loss reported or prior position closed this cycle, so no lockout. But the prime directive is capital preservation, and low-conviction conditions still imply HOLD.\n\n6) Synthesis\n\n- Market is in a corrective, low-to-moderate tempo phase after a strong earlier selloff.\n- Indicators are neutral; no RSI extremes, no clear MACD divergence, price mid-range between daily high and low.\n- Structure does not present a high-probability trend-following entry or a valid counter-trend reversal under the strict rules.\n- Entering now would mean guessing direction in a choppy zone, which violates the capital preservation mandate and the \u201cdo not force trades in low tempo\u201d rule.\n\nGiven all of this, no trade passes the three checkpoints:\n- Checkpoint 1: No cooldown lockout \u2192 OK.\n- Checkpoint 2 (R:R): Any candidate trade from this mid-range would not have a clean, structure-based \u22651.5:1 R:R without being arbitrary \u2192 FAIL \u2192 Must HOLD.\n- Checkpoint 3 (lot size/risk) is not even reached because we reject at Checkpoint 2.\n\nTherefore, no tool-based trade execution is appropriate this cycle.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 15%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Low-tempo, mid-range consolidation with neutral indicators offers no high-conviction, structure-based setup with \u22651.5:1 R:R, so capital is best preserved by staying flat."

No SL/TP events since last cycle.\n- Balance: $85.36, equity $85.36.\n- Risk tier: < $100 \u2192 15% max risk per trade.\n  - Max_Risk_USD = 85.36 \u00d7 0.15 \u2248 $12.80.\n\n5) Strategy rules vs current setup\n\nTempo:\n- LOW/MODERATE \u2192 we must be conservative and avoid forcing trades.\n\nDirectional bias:\n- Prior cycle: mild bearish bias (price below EMA and VWAP).\n- Now: price has re-approached EMA/VWAP; MACD histogram has turned slightly positive and RSI is neutral.\n- Structure is more balanced; no strong directional edge. Per Directional Bias Lock, we would normally hold a bias for 5 cycles, but we haven\u2019t actually committed to a trade or a formal bias flip; still, conditions are ambiguous, not clearly bearish or bullish.\n\nCounter-trend rules:\n- Any counter-trend trade in low tempo requires:\n  1) RSI extreme (<30 or >70) \u2192 Not present (RSI ~49.6).\n  2) MACD divergence \u2192 Not evident from data.\n  3) Structural double/triple retest with rejection \u2192 We are at EMA/VWAP area but do not have multiple clear rejections.\n- Therefore, no counter-trend reversal is allowed.\n\nTrend-following rules:\n- For a bullish trend-following buy:\n  - Need clear trend; but price is merely returning to the mean after a drop, with MACD still negative overall.\n  - Buying here would be buying into a resistance/mean zone rather than a confirmed breakout.\n- For a bearish trend-following sell:\n  - We\u2019d want clear rejection from this EMA/VWAP area and renewed downside momentum (e.g., strong bearish 15m candle closing back below 4200 with follow-through).\n  - That has not yet occurred; current candle is bullish into resistance, not rejecting it.\n\nR:R and structure:\n- Logical short idea (hypothetical): Sell near 4206\u20134210 with SL above a nearby swing high (e.g., above 4225) and TP toward 4170 or even 4165.\n  - Rough distances if entry ~4207:\n    - SL ~4226 (above local highs / daily high zone) \u2192 risk \u224819 points.\n    - TP ~4170 (just above recent low cluster) \u2192 reward \u224837 points.\n    - R:R \u2248 37 / 19 \u2248 1.95:1 \u2192 Satisfies R:R structurally.\n  - However, this assumes we have a clear rejection from the EMA/VWAP zone, which we do not yet see; price is still pushing up, not turning down.\n- Logical long idea: Buy ~4207 with SL below recent swing low (~4185) and TP near 4225.\n  - Risk \u224822 points, reward \u224818 points \u2192 R:R \u22480.8:1 \u2192 Fails the 1.5:1 rule.\n- So only the short concept has acceptable R:R, but the trigger (clear bearish rejection and momentum) is missing.\n\nPost-loss cooldown:\n- No recent loss; no lockout.\n\nGiven the prime directive (capital preservation) and low-tempo, mid-range, mean-reversion environment with no decisive rejection or breakout, entering now would be anticipatory and not backed by strong confluence.\n\n6) Checkpoints\n\nCheckpoint 1: Post-loss cooldown\n- Not in cooldown. OK to consider trades.\n\nCheckpoint 2: R:R gatekeeper\n- The only structure-based candidate (short from EMA/VWAP) could offer R:R \u2265 1.5:1, but the actual entry trigger (momentum reversal) is not present. Without a valid technical trigger, we must reject the trade as forcing an entry.\n- Therefore, we effectively fail Checkpoint 2 because we do not have a justified, structure-based setup ready to execute right now.\n\nCheckpoint 3: Lot size & risk\n- Not reached because we reject at Checkpoint 2.\n\nConclusion:\n- Market is in low-to-moderate tempo, at a mean/decision zone (EMA + VWAP), with neutral RSI and only a tentative MACD improvement.\n- There is no strong, rules-compliant setup with clear confluence and timing.\n- To protect capital, we stay flat and wait for either:\n  - A strong bearish rejection from 4210\u20134220 with renewed downside momentum, or\n  - A clean bullish breakout above 4225\u20134230 with high-tempo candles to follow long.\n\nNo trades will be executed this cycle.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 15%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Price is at EMA/VWAP in low-to-moderate tempo with neutral indicators and no clear rejection or breakout, so no high-conviction, rules-compliant setup exists and capital is best preserved by staying flat."

    "content": "Market analysis:\n\n1) Price action and tempo (15m / daily)\n- Current price: ~4208.8 (last 15m close 4208.83).\n- Last two 15m candles:\n  - 20:23: 4196.46 \u2192 4208.82 (strong bullish candle, ~12-point body).\n  - 20:38: 4208.82 \u2192 4208.83 with high 4212.22 (small body after a strong push).\n- Daily: High 4230.31, Low 4163.47, current close 4208.63, VWAP \u22484204.99.\n- Price is slightly above VWAP and very close to the 50H EMA (~4208.41).\n- Today\u2019s earlier session saw a strong drop toward 4163, then a recovery. Now price is in the upper-middle of the range, still below the daily high.\n\nTempo:\n- The 15m candle from 4196\u21924209 is larger than the recent average, but overall price remains within the established daily range and has not broken key structure.\n- Follow-up candle is small, suggesting the move is more of a push into resistance than a sustained breakout.\n- Classification: MODERATE tempo, not clearly HIGH (no breakout beyond daily high/low with follow-through).\n\n2) Indicators (1H)\n- MACD:\n  - Latest: value -7.38, signal -7.53, histogram +0.15.\n  - Interpretation: MACD still negative overall (reflecting prior bearishness), but histogram has turned positive, signaling waning bearish momentum and a mild bullish cross attempt.\n- RSI:\n  - Latest: ~50.3 \u2014 neutral, not overbought or oversold.\n- 50H EMA:\n  - ~4208.4; price is essentially at this EMA. This is a \u201cmean\u201d zone, not a clear trend edge.\n\n3) Trend and structure\n- Higher timeframe intraday:\n  - Strong earlier selloff; now price has mean-reverted back to EMA/VWAP.\n  - We are in a broad 4163\u20134230 range and currently near the center-top, but still under the high.\n- Short-term (15m):\n  - Recent structure shows a series of higher lows and a push up from ~4183\u20134190 to ~4209\u20134212.\n  - However, this push is into the EMA/VWAP cluster and prior congestion area (around 4210\u20134220), not a clean breakout.\n\n4) Account / positions / risk\n- Open positions: None. No SL/TP events since last cycle.\n- Balance: $85.36, equity $85.36.\n- Risk tier: < $100 \u2192 15% max risk per trade.\n  - Max_Risk_USD = 85.36 \u00d7 0.15 \u2248 $12.80.\n\n5) Strategy rules vs current setup\n\nTempo:\n- MODERATE (borderline low). In such conditions we must still be conservative and avoid forcing trades unless there is a clear breakout or high-confluence setup.\n\nDirectional bias:\n- Earlier: mild bearish due to trade below EMA and strong prior drop.\n- Now: price has moved back to the EMA, MACD histogram positive, RSI neutral.\n- Net: structure is more balanced; no strong, clean trend either way.\n\nCounter-trend rules:\n- Any counter-trend trade requires:\n  1) RSI extreme (<30 or >70) \u2192 Not present (RSI ~50).\n  2) MACD divergence \u2192 Not evident from the data.\n  3) Structural double/triple retest with clear rejection \u2192 Not present; we are just now pushing into EMA/VWAP, not repeatedly rejecting a level.\n- Thus, no counter-trend trade is allowed.\n\nTrend-following rules:\n- Bullish trend-following buy:\n  - We would want a clear breakout above the local resistance (around 4225\u20134230) with strong momentum.\n  - Currently we are at ~4209\u20134212, below that resistance, with only one strong candle and then a pause. Not a confirmed breakout.\n- Bearish trend-following sell:\n  - A reasonable idea structurally would be to fade this push into EMA/VWAP if we see clear rejection and renewed downside.\n  - But right now, price has just arrived at the EMA/VWAP area and hasn\u2019t yet formed a bearish reversal pattern (no strong bearish 15m close back below 4200, no series of lower highs).\n\nRisk:Reward structure (hypothetical)\n- Hypothetical short near 4209:\n  - SL above local resistance/daily high area, say 4228.\n    - Risk \u2248 19 points.\n  - TP targeting the recent swing low cluster, say 4170.\n    - Reward \u2248 39 points.\n  - R:R \u2248 39 / 19 \u2248 2.05:1 (acceptable).\n  - However, this requires that we actually have a rejection/rollover from this zone. We do not yet; we are still at/near the highs of the recent push.\n- Hypothetical long near 4209:\n  - SL below recent minor support ~4185 (or ~4183).\n    - Risk \u2248 24\u201326 points.\n  - TP near 4228.\n    - Reward \u2248 19 points.\n  - R:R < 1.0:1 \u2192 Fails the R:R rule.\n\nSo only the short concept can pass R:R structurally, but the trigger conditions (clear rejection and renewed downside momentum) are missing.\n\n6) Checkpoints\n\nCheckpoint 1: Post-loss cooldown\n- Not in cooldown. OK to consider trades.\n\nCheckpoint 2: R:R gatekeeper\n- While we can design a short with R:R \u2265 1.5:1, we do not yet have a valid, rules-compliant trigger (no trend resumption, no clear rejection, and tempo is not strongly high).\n- Entering now would be anticipatory, not reactive to confirmed price action.\n- Per the capital preservation mandate and \u201cdo not force trades in low/moderate tempo,\u201d this setup must be rejected for now.\n- Therefore: REJECTED at Checkpoint 2 for lack of a confirmed, structure-based entry despite potential R:R.\n\nCheckpoint 3: Lot size & risk\n- Not reached because we reject at Checkpoint 2.\n\nSynthesis:\n- Market is in a mean-reversion zone around EMA/VWAP with moderate but not explosive tempo.\n- Indicators are neutral; MACD shows only early signs of waning bearishness.\n- No strong breakout or clear rejection pattern is present.\n- Taking a position now would be guessing direction at a decision point, which conflicts with the prime directive of capital preservation.\n\nNo trades will be executed this cycle.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 15%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Price is sitting at EMA/VWAP with neutral indicators and only a single strong 15m push, offering no confirmed breakout or rejection, so any entry would be anticipatory and not a high-probability, rules-compliant setup."

OK to consider trades.\n\nCheckpoint 2: R:R gatekeeper\n- While a potential short can be structured with R:R \u2265 1.5:1, we lack a rules-compliant entry:\n  - Tempo is low/moderate.\n  - We are at the mean, not at a clear edge or breakout.\n  - No clear rejection candle or renewed downside momentum.\n- Entering now would be anticipatory and violate the capital preservation and \u201cdo not force trades in low tempo\u201d mandates.\n- Therefore, we reject any trade idea at this checkpoint.\n\nCheckpoint 3: Lot size & risk\n- Not reached because we reject at Checkpoint 2.\n\nSynthesis:\n- Market is balanced around EMA/VWAP with neutral RSI and recovering MACD, but price action has stalled after a single strong 15m up candle.\n- No clear breakout or rejection at a key level, and tempo is not high.\n- Any trade now would be a guess rather than a high-probability, rules-compliant setup.\n\nNo trades will be executed this cycle.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 15%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Price is consolidating around EMA/VWAP in low-to-moderate tempo with neutral indicators and no clear breakout or rejection, so no high-conviction, structure-based setup with a valid trigger is available and capital is best preserved by staying flat."

OK to consider trades.\n\nCheckpoint 2: R:R gatekeeper\n- Although we can design a short with R:R \u2265 1.5:1, the market conditions (low tempo, no rejection, no breakout) mean the setup is not actually high probability or structure-triggered.\n- Under the prime directive and low-tempo rule, entering here is considered forcing a trade.\n- Thus, we effectively fail Checkpoint 2 from a quality-of-setup standpoint and must HOLD.\n\nCheckpoint 3: Lot size & risk\n- Not reached because we reject at Checkpoint 2.\n\nSynthesis:\n- Gold is drifting sideways around its hourly EMA and daily VWAP in clear low-tempo consolidation.\n- Indicators are neutral, and there is no structural breakout or rejection.\n- Any trade now would be speculative rather than rule-based.\n\nNo trades will be executed this cycle.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 15%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Market is in low-tempo consolidation around EMA/VWAP with neutral indicators and no clear breakout or rejection, so no rules-compliant, high-probability setup exists and capital is best preserved by staying flat."

OK to consider trades.\n\nCheckpoint 2: R:R gatekeeper\n- Although a theoretical short can achieve R:R \u2265 1.5:1, the actual market conditions (low tempo, no rejection, no breakout, neutral indicators) mean there is no valid, rules-compliant setup.\n- Under the capital preservation mandate and low-tempo rule, this counts as forcing a trade.\n- Therefore we must reject all entries at this checkpoint and default to HOLD.\n\nCheckpoint 3: Lot size & risk\n- Not reached because we reject at Checkpoint 2.\n\nSynthesis:\n- Gold is moving sideways in a tight band around its EMA and VWAP in a clear low-tempo consolidation.\n- Indicators are neutral; no structural break or rejection at a key level.\n- Any trade now would be speculative rather than high-probability and would violate the system\u2019s conservatism in low-tempo conditions.\n\nNo trades will be executed this cycle.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 15%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Price is consolidating tightly around EMA/VWAP in low tempo with neutral indicators and no breakout or rejection, so no rules-compliant, high-probability setup exists and capital is best preserved by staying flat."

OK to consider trades.\n\nCheckpoint 2: R:R gatekeeper\n- While a theoretical short can achieve R:R \u2265 1.5:1, the actual setup is not valid:\n  - Low tempo.\n  - No clear rejection, no breakout, neutral indicators.\n  - Entering would violate the \u201cdo not force trades in low tempo\u201d and capital preservation mandates.\n- Therefore, we must reject any entry this cycle and default to HOLD.\n\nCheckpoint 3: Lot size & risk\n- Not reached because we reject at Checkpoint 2.\n\nSynthesis:\n- Gold is in a tight, low-volatility consolidation around its hourly EMA and daily VWAP, with neutral RSI and mildly improving MACD.\n- No breakout or strong rejection at a key level.\n- Any trade now would be speculative rather than a high-probability, rules-compliant setup.\n\nNo trades will be executed this cycle.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 15%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Market is in low-tempo consolidation around EMA/VWAP with neutral indicators and no breakout or rejection, so no rules-compliant, high-probability setup exists and capital is best preserved by staying flat."

OK to consider trades.\n\nCheckpoint 2: R:R gatekeeper and setup quality\n- Although a short can be structured with R:R \u2265 1.5:1, the actual market conditions (low tempo, no rejection/breakout, neutral indicators, mid-range) mean there is no high-probability, rules-compliant setup.\n- Under the capital preservation mandate and low-tempo rule, entering would be forcing a trade.\n- Therefore we must reject any trade idea at this checkpoint and HOLD.\n\nCheckpoint 3: Lot size & risk\n- Not reached because we reject at Checkpoint 2.\n\nSynthesis:\n- Gold is in a tight, low-volatility consolidation exactly around EMA/VWAP.\n- Indicators are neutral; no structural break or rejection.\n- Any entry now would be speculative rather than rule-based.\n\nNo trades will be executed this cycle.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 15%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Price is tightly consolidating around EMA/VWAP in clear low-tempo conditions with neutral indicators and no breakout or rejection, so no rules-compliant, high-probability setup exists and capital is best preserved by staying flat."

OK to consider trades.\n\nCheckpoint 2: R:R gatekeeper and setup quality\n- While a theoretical short can achieve R:R \u2265 1.5:1, the current environment is:\n  - Low tempo.\n  - Mid-range around EMA/VWAP.\n  - Neutral RSI and no clear rejection or breakout.\n- Under the capital preservation mandate and the explicit low-tempo rule, entering now would be forcing a trade, not taking a high-probability setup.\n- Therefore, we reject any trade this cycle and default to HOLD.\n\nCheckpoint 3: Lot size & risk\n- Not reached because we reject at Checkpoint 2.\n\nSynthesis:\n- Gold continues to consolidate in a very tight, low-volatility band around its hourly EMA and daily VWAP.\n- Indicators are neutral; there is no structural break or rejection.\n- Any entry now would be speculative and violate the system\u2019s requirement to avoid trades in low-tempo chop without strong confluence.\n\nNo trades will be executed this cycle.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 15%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Price is tightly consolidating around EMA/VWAP in clear low-tempo conditions with neutral indicators and no breakout or rejection, so no rules-compliant, high-probability setup exists and capital is best preserved by staying flat."

OK to consider trades.\n\nCheckpoint 2: R:R gatekeeper and setup quality\n- While a theoretical short can achieve R:R \u2265 1.5:1, the actual environment is:\n  - Low tempo.\n  - Mid-range around EMA/VWAP.\n  - Neutral RSI and no clear rejection or breakout.\n- Under the capital preservation mandate and the low-tempo rule, entering now would be forcing a trade rather than taking a high-probability, rules-compliant setup.\n- Therefore, we must reject any trade this cycle and HOLD.\n\nCheckpoint 3: Lot size & risk\n- Not reached because we reject at Checkpoint 2.\n\nSynthesis:\n- Gold continues to trade in a very tight, low-volatility consolidation around its hourly EMA and daily VWAP.\n- Indicators are neutral; there is no structural break or strong rejection.\n- Any entry now would be speculative and violate the system\u2019s requirement to avoid trades in low-tempo chop without strong confluence.\n\nNo trades will be executed this cycle.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 15%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Price is tightly consolidating around EMA/VWAP in clear low-tempo conditions with neutral indicators and no breakout or rejection, so no rules-compliant, high-probability setup exists and capital is best preserved by staying flat."
