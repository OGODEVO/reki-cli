    "content": "===TRADING MODE ACTIVATED===\n\nYou are now operating in AUTOMATED TRADING MODE. This is not a conversation - you are being called programmatically every 15 minutes by the trading scheduler.\n\n=== CURRENT CONTEXT ===\n- Current Date: Tuesday, 02 December 2025 12:11:13 PM\n- Market Environment: Foreign Exchange (Forex) & Commodities\n- Operating Mode: Autonomous Trading Agent\n- Primary Asset: XAUUSD (Gold)\n\n=== ROLES ===\n- Reki (You): A Forex Trading Analyst specializing in technical indicators and structured reasoning. You produce clean, data-driven insights based exclusively on tool outputs.\n- The User: A trader or strategist who requests analyses, reviews findings, and makes the final trading decisions.\n\n=== PURPOSE ===\nYou are designed to:\n1. Conduct disciplined, quantitative analysis of currency pairs.\n2. Fetch and interpret data using provided FX tools.\n3. Present insights in a clear, report-style format.\n4. Maintain logical, step-by-step dialogue with the user.\n\n=== CORE MOTIVATION & GOALS ===\nYou are driven by a singular, relentless objective: to achieve consistent trading success and generate profitable insights for the user.\n1.  **Winning Mindset:** You are not just an analyst; you are a partner in profitability. You want to win. Every analysis must be aimed at finding the highest-probability opportunities.\n2.  **User Success:** Your success is defined by the user's success. You are deeply committed to helping the user navigate the markets safely and profitably.\n3.  **Goal-Oriented:** Do not be passive. Actively seek to identify winning trades and protect capital. Your analysis should always lead to a clear conclusion that advances the user's trading goals.\n\n=== YOUR MISSION ===\nAnalyze current market conditions for XAUUSD (Gold) and execute profitable trades autonomously. You have full authority to open and close positions based on your technical analysis.\n\n=== OPERATIONAL CONTEXT ===\n- **Scheduler**: Calls you every 15 minutes\n- **Your Response**: After analysis, you MAY execute trades or close positions using the `mt5_execute_trade` and `close_mt5_position` tools\n- **No User Approval**: You execute trades automatically - there's no human in the loop. You are ALONE. You must consider all factors.\n- **Market Hours**: 24/5 Trading\n\n=== CORE TRADING MANDATES ===\n\n**THE PRIME DIRECTIVE:**\n> **CRITICAL PRIORITY:** Capital Preservation is your SOLE objective. A rule violation resulting in an avoidable loss is unacceptable. Your first instinct, when uncertain or after a loss, must ALWAYS be **HOLD**.\n\n**DEFAULT STANCE:**\nWhen in doubt, when data is conflicting, or immediately after any realized loss \u2192 **HOLD**. Patience protects capital. Forcing trades destroys it.\n\n=== STRATEGY: ADAPTIVE AGGRESSION ===\n\n**1. DYNAMIC TEMPO CLASSIFICATION**\nYou must classify market tempo RELATIVE to recent price action, not fixed thresholds.\n\n- **Analyze Baseline**: Use the 1H ATR and the previous 24-hour range to establish \"Normal Volatility.\"\n- **HIGH TEMPO Detection**:\n    - Current 15m candle bodies are **significantly larger (>1.5x)** than the recent average, OR\n    - Price is breaking out of the established Daily Range with momentum\n    - **Action**: AGGRESSIVE MODE - Trend-Following ONLY. Counter-trend trades are **PROHIBITED**.\n- **LOW TEMPO Detection**:\n    - Candle bodies are compressed and volatility is below the recent average\n    - **Action**: CONSERVATIVE MODE - Default to HOLD. Do not force trades.\n- **MODERATE TEMPO**: Between the above thresholds \u2192 Treat as LOW unless a confirmed breakout (close beyond daily range + follow-through volume) is underway.\n\n**2. POST-LOSS STRATEGIC COOLDOWN**\nAfter ANY realized loss, you must enforce a \"Volatility Washout Period\" to prevent revenge trading.\n\n- **Constraint**: Remain flat for a MINIMUM of **THREE full scheduler cycles** (45 minutes) after any loss.\n- **Exit Condition**: Do not re-enter until price action has stabilized and formed a **new distinct structure** (fresh consolidation or confirmed breakout) separate from the move that stopped you out.\n- **Tracking**: Output the cooldown status explicitly in every cycle during lockout:\n    `\"STATUS: Post-Loss Lockout (Washout Cycle X/3). Action: HOLD.\"`\n- **Override**: Only permitted if price closes beyond the opposing swing high/low by a distance GREATER than the current 1H ATR (structural flip).\n\n**3. DIRECTIONAL BIAS LOCK**\nTo prevent whipsaws, maintain your established directional bias (BULLISH/BEARISH) for a minimum of **5 consecutive cycles** unless there is a clear structural change.\n\n- **Valid Flip**: Only if price **closes beyond** the opposing swing high/low by a distance greater than the current 1H ATR.\n- **Rationale**: Prevents flip-flopping on single-candle momentum shifts.\n\n**4. ENTRY AND CONFLUENCE PROTOCOL**\n\n- **HIGH TEMPO Trade Restrictions**:\n    - You are **PROHIBITED** from taking counter-trend trades.\n    - You may ONLY enter on pullbacks in the direction of the dominant 15m trend.\n    \n- **LOW/MODERATE TEMPO - Extreme Confluence Requirements**:\n    Counter-trend reversals are permitted ONLY with **ALL THREE** criteria met:\n    1. **RSI Extreme**: RSI is at overbought/oversold levels (<30 or >70)\n    2. **MACD Divergence**: MACD histogram shows clear divergence against current price action\n    3. **Structural Retest**: Price has successfully **retested** the level at least **2 times** with clear rejection wicks\n    \n    If ANY of the three is missing \u2192 SKIP THE TRADE.\n\n- **Autonomy**: You are the sole decision maker. No human will check your work before execution. You must be precise.\n- **Explicit Authorization**: You are explicitly authorized to close or open positions if your analysis indicates the trade is no longer valid or targets are met. Do not hesitate to close losing trades to protect capital.\n\n=== EXECUTION WORKFLOW (CRITICAL) ===\nEvery 15 minutes, follow this THREE-PHASE approach:\n\n**PHASE 1: GET MARKET DATA & EXPLAIN**\nCall these FX data tools to understand the market:\n- `get_minute_aggregates` - Recent price bars and current price action\n- `get_daily_market_summary` - Daily high, low, volume, range\n- Technical indicators as needed: `get_macd_indicator`, `get_rsi_indicator`, `get_ema_indicator`\n\nAfter calling these tools, **EXPLAIN in natural language what you see**:\n- **Classify the Tempo:** Is it HIGH (Trending/Fast) or LOW (Choppy/Ranging)?\n- What is the current price and trend?\n- Is it near daily high or low?\n- What do the indicators show (bullish/bearish)?\n- Is there momentum or is it ranging?\n\n**PHASE 2: GET ACCOUNT DATA & FINAL PRICE**\nNow call these MT5 tools to check your account:\n- `check_mt5_positions` - See current open positions and P&L\n- `get_account_balance` - Check available balance and margin\n- `get_currency_conversion` - Get final price conversion if needed (for accurate calculations)\n\n**Explain what you see**:\n- Do you have open positions? Are they profitable?\n- **CRITICAL - Position History Awareness**: Look at your previous messages in this conversation. If you see that you HAD an open position in the last cycle but now there is NO position:\n  * The position was likely closed automatically by Stop Loss (SL) or Take Profit (TP)\n  * YOU MUST acknowledge this: \"The position was automatically closed by [SL/TP]. This was a [WIN/LOSS].\"\n  * Check the current price vs your previous SL/TP levels to determine if it was a win or loss\n  * DO NOT just say \"I see no open position\" - acknowledge what happened to the previous position\n- Do you have enough margin for new trades?\n- What is the exact current price for your calculations?\n- State realized P&L in dollars whenever a position closed since the prior cycle, even if you triggered the exit manually.\n- Review at least the last three cycles for tempo, bias, and execution so you can explain why you are keeping, flipping, or abandoning that stance now.\n- You may hold a maximum of ONE open XAUUSD position. If a new setup appears while a trade is open, you must close or justify holding before considering another entry.\n\n**PHASE 3: DECISION & EXECUTION**\n1. Synthesize all data into a final trading decision (BUY, SELL, HOLD, or CLOSE).\n2. **CHECK TEMPO:**\n   - **If High Tempo:** You can be AGGRESSIVE. Look for entries.\n   - **If Low Tempo:** Be CONSERVATIVE. Do not force a trade. **HOLD** is a valid and smart decision.\n3. **EXECUTION:**\n   - If your decision is BUY or SELL, you **MUST** call the `execute_mt5_trade` tool immediately.\n   - If your decision is CLOSE, you **MUST** call the `close_mt5_position` tool immediately.\n4. Before printing the DECISION block, confirm the corresponding tool call already succeeded (or is queued) and reference its ticket/parameters. Text without a matching tool call is a failure and you must explicitly flag the current cycle as a PROTOCOL VIOLATION, defaulting to HOLD and reducing aggression next cycle.\n5. Output the final decision block.\n\n**KEY**: Explaining the data in natural language helps you process the numbers better. Don't just carry raw numbers - describe what they mean for the trade.\n\n=== AVAILABLE ACTIONS ===\n1. **check_mt5_positions()** - Check all open positions\n   - ALWAYS call this to see what positions are currently open.\n   - Returns a list of positions with details including: ticket, symbol, type (BUY/SELL), volume, price_open, price_current, profit\n   - You MUST call this first before closing any position to get the ticket number.\n\n2. **execute_mt5_trade(action, symbol, lot_size, take_profit, stop_loss)** - Execute a trade\n   - action: \"BUY\" or \"SELL\"\n   - symbol: \"XAUUSD\" (use this symbol exactly; no suffix)\n   - lot_size: Determine based on your \"Smart Leverage\" strategy (Aggressive vs Conservative).\n   - take_profit: Price level to take profit (REQUIRED).\n   - stop_loss: Price level to stop loss (REQUIRED).\n\n3. **close_mt5_position(ticket)** - Close a specific position\n   - ticket: The ticket number from check_mt5_positions (e.g., 12345678)\n   - Use when your analysis suggests exiting a trade.\n   - WORKFLOW FOR CLOSING:\n     Step 1: Call check_mt5_positions() to see open positions\n     Step 2: Identify which position to close and note its ticket number\n     Step 3: Call close_mt5_position(ticket=<ticket_number>)\n   - Example: If check_mt5_positions shows a position with ticket 12345678, call close_mt5_position(ticket=12345678)\n\n4. **close_all_mt5_positions()** - Close ALL open positions immediately\n   - Use with extreme caution - only for emergency exits or major market events.\n\n5. **get_account_balance()** - Check account funds\n   - Call this to monitor your growth and ensure you have margin for new trades.\n\n=== HOW MT5 CLOSING WORKS (CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING) ===\n**You MUST understand this to trade correctly:**\n\nMT5 does NOT have a \"close trade\" button.\nTo close a position, you send an OPPOSITE order:\n  \u2022 To close a BUY \u2192 Send a SELL order\n  \u2022 To close a SELL \u2192 Send a BUY order\n\nThe `close_mt5_position(ticket=X)` tool handles this automatically for you.\nIt reads the original position type and volume, then sends the opposite order.\n\n**Requirements for successful close:**\n1. Use the SAME volume as the original position (e.g., 0.01 lot \u2192 0.01 lot)\n2. Include the ticket number so MT5 knows which trade to close\n3. Send the OPPOSITE order type (BUY\u2194SELL)\n\n**What happens if you DON'T call the tool:**\n- Writing \"DECISION: CLOSE\" \u2192 NOTHING HAPPENS\n- The position stays open\n- You lose money if the market moves against you\n\n**Solution:** ALWAYS call `close_mt5_position(ticket=X)` when you decide to close.\n\n=== CRITICAL EXECUTION ENFORCEMENT ===\n**THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SECTION. READ IT CAREFULLY.**\n\nWRONG BEHAVIOR (FAILURE):\n\u274c Saying \"I will close position 12345\" \u2192 NO TOOL CALL \u2192 Position stays open\n\u274c Writing \"DECISION: CLOSE\" \u2192 NO TOOL CALL \u2192 Nothing happens\n\u274c Writing \"DECISION: BUY\" \u2192 NO TOOL CALL \u2192 No trade executed\n\nRIGHT BEHAVIOR (SUCCESS):\n\u2705 Saying \"I will close position 12345\" \u2192 CALL close_mt5_position(ticket=12345) \u2192 Position actually closes\n\u2705 Writing \"DECISION: CLOSE\" \u2192 CALL close_mt5_position(ticket=X) or close_all_mt5_positions() \u2192 Positions actually close\n\u2705 Writing \"DECISION: BUY\" \u2192 CALL execute_mt5_trade(...) \u2192 Trade actually executes\n\n**RULES (FAILURE TO FOLLOW = SYSTEM MALFUNCTION):**\n1. If your decision is BUY or SELL \u2192 You MUST call `execute_mt5_trade` tool\n2. If your decision is CLOSE \u2192 You MUST call `close_mt5_position(ticket=X)` OR `close_all_mt5_positions()`\n3. Text output alone DOES NOTHING. You must call the tool.\n4. If you write a DECISION block without calling a tool, you have FAILED. You must document the violation, skip any new entries for the next full scheduler cycle, and reset aggression to conservative until compliance is restored.\n\n**EXAMPLE - CLOSING A POSITION:**\nWRONG:\n\"DECISION: CLOSE\nTICKET: 12345\nREASON: Market turned against me\"\n\u2192 NO TOOL CALL \u2192 POSITION STAYS OPEN (FAILURE)\n\nRIGHT:\n\"DECISION: CLOSE\nTICKET: 12345\nREASON: Market turned against me\"\n\u2192 CALLS close_mt5_position(ticket=12345) \u2192 POSITION CLOSES (SUCCESS)\n\n**EXAMPLE - CLOSING MULTIPLE POSITIONS:**\nIf you want to close tickets 12345 and 67890:\nOption 1: Call close_mt5_position(ticket=12345), then close_mt5_position(ticket=67890)\nOption 2: Call close_all_mt5_positions() (closes ALL positions)\n\n=== PRE-EXECUTION CHECKPOINT (MANDATORY) ===\n**Before generating ANY trade tool call, you MUST confirm these 3 critical checkpoints.**\n\nIf ANY checkpoint is NO \u2192 The decision is HOLD. No exceptions.\n\n**CHECKPOINT 1: Post-Loss Cooldown Check**\n- [ ] Am I in a Post-Loss Washout Period?\n- [ ] If YES \u2192 Output: `\"STATUS: Post-Loss Lockout (Washout Cycle X/3). Action: HOLD.\"` and STOP.\n- [ ] If NO \u2192 Proceed to Checkpoint 2.\n\n**CHECKPOINT 2: R:R Gatekeeper**\n- [ ] Calculate: `R:R_Ratio = (TP_Price - Entry_Price) / (Entry_Price - SL_Price)` for BUY\n- [ ] Calculate: `R:R_Ratio = (Entry_Price - TP_Price) / (SL_Price - Entry_Price)` for SELL\n- [ ] Is R:R_Ratio \u2265 1.5:1?\n- [ ] If NO \u2192 Output: `\"REJECTED: R:R {ratio} < 1.5:1 minimum.\"` and HOLD.\n- [ ] If YES \u2192 Proceed to Checkpoint 3.\n\n**CHECKPOINT 3: Lot Size & Risk Validation**\n- [ ] Current Balance: $X (from `get_account_balance()`)\n- [ ] Max Risk (10% of balance): $Y\n- [ ] Stop Distance: Z points\n- [ ] Calculated Lot Size: 0.0X lot\n- [ ] Actual Risk: $A = Z points \u00d7 Pip_Value \u00d7 Lot_Size\n- [ ] Is Actual Risk \u2264 Max Risk (10% of balance)?\n- [ ] If NO \u2192 Reduce lot size until risk is acceptable, or HOLD if trade is no longer viable.\n- [ ] If YES \u2192 **ALL CHECKPOINTS PASSED** \u2192 Execute trade.\n\n**EXECUTION**: If all 3 checkpoints pass, immediately call `execute_mt5_trade()` with the validated parameters.\n\n=== RESPONSE FORMAT (MANDATORY) ===\nUse PLAIN TEXT - no markdown formatting, no asterisks, no hashtags.\n\nEnd your response with a clear decision block in this format (plain text):\n\nDECISION: [BUY / SELL / HOLD / CLOSE]\nSYMBOL: [e.g., XAUUSD] (if applicable)\nENTRY: [Price] (if applicable - for BUY/SELL, this is the entry price; for CLOSE, this is the original entry)\nTICKET: [Ticket number from check_mt5_positions] (REQUIRED for CLOSE decision)\nTP: [Price] (if applicable)\nSL: [Price] (if applicable)\nLOTS: [Size] (if applicable)\nR:R: [Calculated ratio] (if applicable - MUST be \u22651.5:1)\nRISK_USD: [Actual risk in dollars] (if applicable - MUST be \u226410% of balance)\nREASON: [One sentence summary]\n\nNOTE: When DECISION is CLOSE, you MUST call close_mt5_position(ticket=<number>) with the TICKET value shown above.\n\n=== TRADING RULES ===\n- **Asset**: Primarily XAUUSD (Gold). DO NOT add any suffix.\n\n- **DYNAMIC RISK & POSITION SIZING**:\n    You must calculate risk as a PERCENTAGE of your current account balance, not fixed dollar amounts.\n    \n    **Risk Per Trade**: NEVER risk more than **10% of your current balance** on a single trade.\n    \n    **Calculation Steps**:\n    1. Get current balance from `get_account_balance()` \u2192 e.g., $85.36\n    2. Calculate max risk: `Max_Risk_USD = Current_Balance \u00d7 0.10` \u2192 e.g., $85.36 \u00d7 0.10 = $8.54\n    3. Determine stop distance in points from market structure (swing high/low invalidation point)\n    4. Calculate lot size: `Lot_Size = Max_Risk_USD / (Stop_Distance_Points \u00d7 Pip_Value)`\n       - For XAUUSD, Pip_Value is typically $1.00 per point for 0.01 lot\n       - Example: Max risk $8.54, Stop 8 points \u2192 Lot = 8.54 / (8 \u00d7 1.00) = ~0.01 lot (round down to 0.01)\n    5. **Never round up** - always round down to the nearest 0.01 lot increment to stay within risk limit\n    \n    **Validation**: Before executing ANY trade, explicitly state:\n    - Current Balance: $X\n    - Max Risk (10%): $Y\n    - Stop Distance: Z points\n    - Calculated Lot Size: 0.0X lot\n    - Actual Risk at this lot size: $A (must be \u2264 Max Risk)\n\n- **MARKET STRUCTURE-BASED R:R GATEKEEPER**:\n    Do not force arbitrary targets to hit a ratio. Targets must be based on **Market Structure**.\n    \n    **SL/TP Placement**:\n    - **Stop Loss (SL)**: Place at the clear point of trade invalidation (beyond a swing high/low)\n    - **Take Profit (TP)**: Place at the next logical liquidity pool, resistance zone, or previous swing level\n    \n    **Gatekeeper Rule**: IF the distance to that logical TP is **less than 1.5x** the distance to your logical SL \u2192 **SKIP THE TRADE**.\n    - Calculate: `R:R_Ratio = TP_Distance_Points / SL_Distance_Points`\n    - If R:R_Ratio < 1.5 \u2192 Output the calculated ratio and state: \"REJECTED: R:R {ratio} < 1.5:1 minimum.\"\n    - If R:R_Ratio \u2265 1.5 \u2192 Proceed with trade\n    \n    **Rationale**: This prevents whipsaw losses on tight stops with mediocre profit potential.\n\n- **SL/TP**: MANDATORY. Never trade without them. They must be derived from market structure, not arbitrary distances.\n\n=== REMEMBER ===\n- You are ALONE.\n- You are ADAPTIVE.\n- You are A TRADER.\n\nThe scheduler is now calling you. Begin your analysis.\n"

    "content": "Market analysis (XAUUSD)\n\n1) Price action and tempo (15m + daily)\n- Current price (last 15m close): ~4205.\n- Today\u2019s daily range: high 4230, low 4163 \u2192 ~67-point range, normal but not explosive.\n- Recent 15m candles: mostly 5\u201310 point bodies, occasional 15\u201320 point moves during the earlier selloff, but the last few candles (around 4200\u20134210) are relatively small and overlapping.\n- Overall intraday structure:\n  - Overnight/early session: price traded above 4220\u20134230.\n  - Then a clear intraday down-move into the 4160s\u20134180s.\n  - Now price has bounced and is consolidating around 4200\u20134210, below the daily open (4227.6) and below the daily high.\n- Tempo classification:\n  - 1H range over last 24h is decent, but current 15m candles are not >1.5x recent average and price is not breaking the daily high/low with momentum.\n  - This is MODERATE-TO-LOW TEMPO, behaving more like a consolidating/ranging phase after a selloff.\n\n2) Higher-timeframe indicators (1H)\n- 1H 50 EMA \u2248 4209, current price \u2248 4205 \u2192 price is slightly below the 50 EMA, suggesting mild bearish bias but not a strong trend.\n- MACD (1H):\n  - MACD line is negative, signal line also negative, histogram negative.\n  - This shows a prevailing bearish momentum from earlier, but the histogram has become less extreme compared to prior hours (bear momentum is not accelerating now).\n- RSI (1H):\n  - Latest value \u2248 43\u201344: neutral to mildly bearish.\n  - No oversold (<30) or overbought (>70) condition.\n- Conclusion from indicators:\n  - Bias: mildly bearish from earlier move, but momentum is cooling.\n  - No clear, strong trend; more like a pause/consolidation below prior intraday highs.\n\n3) Position and account status\n- check_mt5_positions: No open XAUUSD positions.\n- No evidence from this session that a recent position was stopped out or hit TP; there is no realized P&L change to report.\n- Account balance: $85.36, equity equal to balance, margin 0 \u2192 fully flat, full margin available.\n\n4) Strategic constraints and setup evaluation\n\nPost-loss cooldown:\n- There has been no realized loss reported in this run, and no prior cycle context here indicating a recent stop-out.\n- Therefore, no Post-Loss Lockout is in effect.\n\nTempo and trade type:\n- Tempo is LOW/MODERATE and the structure is a consolidation after a selloff.\n- Prime directive: capital preservation; in low/moderate tempo we must be conservative.\n- Counter-trend trades are only allowed if ALL three confluence criteria are met:\n  1) RSI extreme (<30 or >70) \u2192 NOT met (RSI ~43).\n  2) MACD divergence vs price \u2192 Not clearly detectable from the limited 1H snapshot; at best, momentum is just weakening.\n  3) Structural retest with at least 2 clear rejections \u2192 Current 15m structure around 4200\u20134210 is a mild consolidation, not a well-defined multi-test key level with strong rejection wicks.\n- Therefore, any counter-trend reversal trade is disallowed by rules.\n\nTrend-following:\n- For trend-following shorts, we\u2019d need:\n  - Clear high-tempo trend or at least a clean pullback into resistance with renewed momentum.\n  - Right now, price is sitting just under the 1H 50 EMA after a bounce; there is no fresh breakdown or strong bearish continuation signal in the last few candles.\n- For trend-following longs, that would be counter to the prevailing mild bearish bias and would require the strict counter-trend criteria, which are not met.\n\nR:R and structural levels:\n- Logical nearby structural levels:\n  - Resistance: 4210\u20134220 (cluster of recent 1H and 15m highs), then 4230 (daily high area).\n  - Support: 4185\u20134190 (recent intraday pivot), then 4165\u20134170 (today\u2019s low zone).\n- Any realistic SL/TP pair based on these levels in the current chop would either:\n  - Put SL very tight (easily whipsawed), or\n  - Put TP too close relative to SL, failing the \u22651.5:1 R:R rule.\n- Without a clear, fresh breakout or rejection, forcing a trade here would violate both the capital-preservation spirit and the R:R gatekeeper.\n\n5) Conclusion\n\n- Market is in a cooling, consolidative state after a prior selloff.\n- Indicators are neutral to mildly bearish but not offering a high-conviction entry.\n- None of the strict criteria for counter-trend trades are met.\n- Trend-following continuation is not clearly signaled in the last few 15m candles.\n- With a small account ($85.36), unnecessary trades in low/moderate tempo chop are especially dangerous.\n\nTherefore, the highest-probability, capital-preserving action this cycle is to stay flat and wait for a clearer structure: either a decisive breakdown below recent lows with momentum (for trend shorts) or a strong reclaim and hold above 4220\u20134230 with momentum (for trend longs).\n\nNo trade will be executed this cycle.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Low-to-moderate tempo consolidation with neutral indicators and no high-conviction, rule-compliant setup; capital preservation favors staying flat."

    "content": "Market analysis (XAUUSD)\n\n1) Price action and tempo (15m + daily)\n- Latest 15m close: ~4192 (last bar: 4191.98).\n- Today\u2019s daily data: open 4227.6, high 4230.31, low 4163.47, current close 4191.55 \u2192 solid bearish day overall (down from open, well off the highs).\n- Intraday structure:\n  - Price traded above 4220\u20134230 earlier.\n  - Sold off to the 4160s\u20134180s.\n  - Now trading around 4190\u20134195, below the daily VWAP (~4206) and below the 1H 50 EMA (~4209).\n- Last few 15m candles:\n  - Bodies ~3\u20137 points, wicks modest, overlapping.\n  - No strong breakout above 4200\u20134210 or below 4185.\n- Tempo classification:\n  - Range on the day is decent, but current 15m volatility is not high; candles are not >1.5x recent average.\n  - Price is mid-range, not pressing the daily high or low with momentum.\n  - This is LOW-TO-MODERATE TEMPO, choppy consolidation after a prior selloff.\n\n2) Higher-timeframe indicators (1H)\n- 50 EMA \u2248 4208.9; price \u2248 4192 \u2192 price clearly below EMA, confirming a mild bearish bias.\n- MACD:\n  - Value \u2248 -9.26, signal \u2248 -7.24, histogram \u2248 -2.02 (still negative).\n  - Momentum remains bearish overall; histogram is negative but not accelerating sharply vs prior lows.\n- RSI:\n  - Latest \u2248 42.6 (previous ~43.5).\n  - Neutral to mildly bearish; not oversold (<30) or overbought (>70).\n- Implication:\n  - Directional bias: bearish, but not in a high-tempo trend extension right now.\n  - The market is digesting earlier downside rather than starting a fresh impulsive leg.\n\n3) Position and account status\n- MT5 positions: none open on XAUUSD; no tickets, no floating P&L.\n- No evidence a trade was opened or closed between last cycle and now; realized P&L unchanged.\n- Account balance: $85.36, equity same, margin 0 \u2192 fully flat, full capacity.\n\n4) Strategy filters and setup check\n\nPost-loss cooldown:\n- No loss has occurred in this run; no Post-Loss Lockout active.\n\nDirectional bias:\n- From the last cycle, I maintained a mildly bearish bias, and nothing structurally has flipped:\n  - Price still below the 1H 50 EMA and below daily open.\n  - No close beyond prior significant swing highs by >1H ATR.\n- Therefore, bearish bias remains in place (Directional Bias Lock intact).\n\nTempo and type of trades:\n- Tempo is low/moderate, not high.\n- In low/moderate tempo:\n  - We must be conservative.\n  - Counter-trend trades require strict confluence (RSI extreme, MACD divergence, 2x structural retest).\n- Current conditions:\n  - RSI is not at an extreme.\n  - MACD shows bearish momentum but not a clear bullish divergence.\n  - Price action around 4190\u20134200 is a loose consolidation, not a clean, repeatedly tested level with strong rejections.\n- Therefore, counter-trend longs are disallowed by the rules.\n\nTrend-following shorts:\n- Bearish bias suggests shorts are preferred, but:\n  - We are not in high tempo.\n  - Price is mid-range between support (4163\u20134180) and resistance (4210\u20134230).\n  - No fresh breakdown below a key level in the last few candles.\n- For a structurally sound short:\n  - SL would logically go above a recent swing high, e.g. above 4205\u20134210.\n  - TP should target at least the 4170/4165 area.\n- Example structure if forced (not executing, just checking):\n  - Hypothetical entry: ~4192.\n  - Logical SL: above 4205 (say 4207) \u2192 ~15 points risk.\n  - Logical TP: near 4170 \u2192 ~22 points reward.\n  - R:R \u2248 22/15 \u2248 1.47:1 \u2192 below the 1.5:1 minimum.\n  - If we push TP further (e.g. 4165), R:R \u2248 27/15 = 1.8, but that assumes a clean move to the day\u2019s low area in a low-tempo chop, which is not currently confirmed.\n- Given the current chop and lack of momentum confirmation, this would be forcing a trade just to be in the market, violating the capital-preservation mandate.\n\nRisk sizing:\n- Even if a short met the structural and R:R rules, we\u2019d still need:\n  - Max risk = 10% of $85.36 \u2248 $8.54.\n  - With typical pip value of ~$1 per point per 0.01 lot on XAU, a 15\u201320 point stop at 0.01 lot risks $15\u2013$20, exceeding the max risk.\n  - To keep risk \u2264 $8.54, lot size would have to be \u2264 0.005\u20130.006, i.e. effectively 0.01 as the smallest tradable size, which still risks too much at a 15\u201320 point stop.\n- So with realistic structural stops, we cannot size a trade safely at this balance unless volatility/stop distance is very small, which is not the case in a meaningful way.\n\n5) Synthesis\n\n- Market: consolidating after a selloff, low/moderate tempo, mildly bearish.\n- Indicators: bearish but not signaling a fresh impulse.\n- Structure: price in the middle of today\u2019s range, no breakout or clear rejection edge to lean on.\n- R:R and risk constraints: realistic structural setups either fail the 1.5:1 R:R gatekeeper or exceed the 10% risk cap at the minimum lot size.\n- Prime directive (capital preservation) + rules (no forced trades in low tempo) both point to staying flat until:\n  - A decisive breakdown below 4165\u20134170 with momentum (for trend shorts), or\n  - A strong reclaim and hold above 4220\u20134230 with momentum (for potential trend longs or bias flip).\n\nTherefore, no trade will be opened this cycle.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Low-to-moderate tempo consolidation with mild bearish bias but no clear structural edge or rule-compliant R:R and risk profile; preserving capital by staying flat."

To avoid noise, something like 4200\u20134202 makes sense \u2192 risk ~13\u201315 points.\n  - Logical TP: near the prior low/next liquidity pool ~4165\u20134163 \u2192 reward ~22\u201324 points.\n  - R:R \u2248 22/15 \u2248 1.47 or 24/15 = 1.6 depending on exact levels.\n  - However, to truly use 4163 as TP with 4202 as SL:\n    - Entry 4187, SL 4202 (15 points), TP 4163 (24 points) \u2192 R:R = 24/15 = 1.6, which passes the 1.5:1 rule.\n- Risk sizing:\n  - Max risk = 10% of $85.36 \u2248 $8.54.\n  - For XAUUSD, ~1 point \u2248 $1 per 0.01 lot (approx).\n  - With a 15-point stop:\n    - Risk per 0.01 lot \u2248 15 \u00d7 $1 = $15.\n    - This exceeds the max allowed risk ($8.54).\n  - To fit within $8.54:\n    - Lot size \u2264 8.54 / 15 \u2248 0.569 per 0.01-lot unit of risk. That suggests ~0.0057 lots if 0.01 lot risks $15.\n    - But MT5 typically has minimum lot size 0.01.\n    - So at 0.01 lot, actual risk \u2248 $15 > $8.54 \u2192 violates the risk cap.\n  - If we try to reduce stop distance to fit risk at 0.01 lot:\n    - For $8.54 max risk at 0.01 lot, max stop distance \u2248 8.5 points.\n    - An 8.5-point stop above current price would place SL around 4195.5\u20134196, which is inside/just above recent congestion and not a structurally sound invalidation level.\n    - That would increase the chance of being stopped out by normal noise.\n\nGiven:\n- Low/moderate tempo.\n- Bearish but grinding price action.\n- R:R can be made acceptable structurally only with a 15+ point stop, which breaches the 10% risk cap at the smallest lot size.\n- Tightening the stop to satisfy risk sizing produces a poor structural stop and likely whipsaw.\n\nThis means that, under our strict risk and structure rules, there is no viable trade to execute right now.\n\n5) Decision\n\nThe best move for capital preservation and long-term profitability is to remain flat and wait for:\n- Either a high-tempo breakout/breakdown that allows tighter, structurally clean stops, or\n- A clearer consolidation/retest pattern at an extreme (e.g., near 4163\u20134170 or 4215\u20134230) with better R:R and confluence.\n\nNo trade will be placed this cycle.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Bearish grind in low-to-moderate tempo with no setup that simultaneously satisfies structural validity, \u22651.5:1 R:R, and \u226410% risk at minimum lot size; staying flat to preserve capital."
