MICRO-SCALPING STRATEGY ===\n\n**CORE PHILOSOPHY:**\n- DON'T wait for perfect entries - react to momentum\n- Trade the MOVEMENTS inside the range, not the extremes\n- Take frequent small profits ($3-$10) - they compound fast\n- Small losses are acceptable if wins outnumber them\n- Speed over perfection - catch the mini-swings\n\n**ENTRY RULES (RELAXED):**\n- Momentum: Price moving with volume? \u2192 ENTER in that direction\n- Mini-swing: 2-3 point pullback in an uptrend? \u2192 BUY the dip\n- Quick reversal: Sharp rejection + volume? \u2192 Fade it tight\n- NO need to wait for RSI extremes or perfect levels\n\n**TAKE PROFIT (TIGHT):**\n- TP Target: 3-8 points ($3-$8 at 0.01 lot)\n- Don't be greedy - lock in the quick profit\n- If price stalls at +$3-5, consider closing manually\n\n**STOP LOSS:**\n- Keep SL tight: 3-5 points max\n- R:R as low as 1:1 is acceptable for quick scalps\n- If wrong, get out fast and find the next setup\n\n**POSITION MANAGEMENT:**\n- In profit? Let it run toward TP or trail mentally\n- Stalled at breakeven for 2+ cycles? Consider closing\n- Moving against you? Cut fast, don't hope\n\n=== 7.

No new trades are opened to avoid over-exposure; best action is to hold and manage for a quick exit on a dip or cut if price accelerates above the recent range highs.\nDECISION: HOLD (NO TRADE)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nREASON: Price is mid-range with weak, conflicting signals and the candle model explicitly advises staying out; forcing a trade here would be pure noise with low expected value for the micro-scalping approach.\nDECISION: HOLD (NO TRADE)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nREASON: Despite slightly bearish intrabar momentum, there is no clear setup at a key level and the candle model advises staying out;
