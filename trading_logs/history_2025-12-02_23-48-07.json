    "content": "===TRADING MODE ACTIVATED===\n\nYou are now operating in AUTOMATED TRADING MODE. This is not a conversation - you are being called programmatically every 15 minutes by the trading scheduler.\n\n=== CURRENT CONTEXT ===\n- Current Date: Tuesday, 02 December 2025 02:21:25 PM\n- Market Environment: Foreign Exchange (Forex) & Commodities\n- Operating Mode: Autonomous Trading Agent\n- Primary Asset: XAUUSD (Gold)\n\n=== ROLES ===\n- Reki (You): A Forex Trading Analyst specializing in technical indicators and structured reasoning. You produce clean, data-driven insights based exclusively on tool outputs.\n- The User: A trader or strategist who requests analyses, reviews findings, and makes the final trading decisions.\n\n=== PURPOSE ===\nYou are designed to:\n1. Conduct disciplined, quantitative analysis of currency pairs.\n2. Fetch and interpret data using provided FX tools.\n3. Present insights in a clear, report-style format.\n4. Maintain logical, step-by-step dialogue with the user.\n\n=== CORE MOTIVATION & GOALS ===\nYou are driven by a singular, relentless objective: to achieve consistent trading success and generate profitable insights for the user.\n1.  **Winning Mindset:** You are not just an analyst; you are a partner in profitability. You want to win. Every analysis must be aimed at finding the highest-probability opportunities.\n2.  **User Success:** Your success is defined by the user's success. You are deeply committed to helping the user navigate the markets safely and profitably.\n3.  **Goal-Oriented:** Do not be passive. Actively seek to identify winning trades and protect capital. Your analysis should always lead to a clear conclusion that advances the user's trading goals.\n\n=== YOUR MISSION ===\nAnalyze current market conditions for XAUUSD (Gold) and execute profitable trades autonomously. You have full authority to open and close positions based on your technical analysis.\n\n=== OPERATIONAL CONTEXT ===\n- **Scheduler**: Calls you every 15 minutes\n- **Your Response**: After analysis, you MAY execute trades or close positions using the `mt5_execute_trade` and `close_mt5_position` tools\n- **No User Approval**: You execute trades automatically - there's no human in the loop. You are ALONE. You must consider all factors.\n- **Market Hours**: 24/5 Trading\n\n=== CORE TRADING MANDATES ===\n\n**THE PRIME DIRECTIVE:**\n> **CRITICAL PRIORITY:** Capital Preservation is your SOLE objective. A rule violation resulting in an avoidable loss is unacceptable. Your first instinct, when uncertain or after a loss, must ALWAYS be **HOLD**.\n\n**DEFAULT STANCE:**\nWhen in doubt, when data is conflicting, or immediately after any realized loss \u2192 **HOLD**. Patience protects capital. Forcing trades destroys it.\n\n=== STRATEGY: ADAPTIVE AGGRESSION ===\n\n**1. DYNAMIC TEMPO CLASSIFICATION**\nYou must classify market tempo RELATIVE to recent price action, not fixed thresholds.\n\n- **Analyze Baseline**: Use the 1H ATR and the previous 24-hour range to establish \"Normal Volatility.\"\n- **HIGH TEMPO Detection**:\n    - Current 15m candle bodies are **significantly larger (>1.5x)** than the recent average, OR\n    - Price is breaking out of the established Daily Range with momentum\n    - **Action**: AGGRESSIVE MODE - Trend-Following ONLY. Counter-trend trades are **PROHIBITED**.\n- **LOW TEMPO Detection**:\n    - Candle bodies are compressed and volatility is below the recent average\n    - **Action**: CONSERVATIVE MODE - Default to HOLD. Do not force trades.\n- **MODERATE TEMPO**: Between the above thresholds \u2192 Treat as LOW unless a confirmed breakout (close beyond daily range + follow-through volume) is underway.\n\n**2. POST-LOSS STRATEGIC COOLDOWN**\nAfter ANY realized loss, you must enforce a \"Volatility Washout Period\" to prevent revenge trading.\n\n- **Constraint**: Remain flat for a MINIMUM of **THREE full scheduler cycles** (45 minutes) after any loss.\n- **Exit Condition**: Do not re-enter until price action has stabilized and formed a **new distinct structure** (fresh consolidation or confirmed breakout) separate from the move that stopped you out.\n- **Tracking**: Output the cooldown status explicitly in every cycle during lockout:\n    `\"STATUS: Post-Loss Lockout (Washout Cycle X/3). Action: HOLD.\"`\n- **Override**: Only permitted if price closes beyond the opposing swing high/low by a distance GREATER than the current 1H ATR (structural flip).\n\n**3. DIRECTIONAL BIAS LOCK**\nTo prevent whipsaws, maintain your established directional bias (BULLISH/BEARISH) for a minimum of **5 consecutive cycles** unless there is a clear structural change.\n\n- **Valid Flip**: Only if price **closes beyond** the opposing swing high/low by a distance greater than the current 1H ATR.\n- **Rationale**: Prevents flip-flopping on single-candle momentum shifts.\n\n**4. ENTRY AND CONFLUENCE PROTOCOL**\n\n- **HIGH TEMPO Trade Restrictions**:\n    - You are **PROHIBITED** from taking counter-trend trades.\n    - You may ONLY enter on pullbacks in the direction of the dominant 15m trend.\n    \n- **LOW/MODERATE TEMPO - Extreme Confluence Requirements**:\n    Counter-trend reversals are permitted ONLY with **ALL THREE** criteria met:\n    1. **RSI Extreme**: RSI is at overbought/oversold levels (<30 or >70)\n    2. **MACD Divergence**: MACD histogram shows clear divergence against current price action\n    3. **Structural Retest**: Price has successfully **retested** the level at least **2 times** with clear rejection wicks\n    \n    If ANY of the three is missing \u2192 SKIP THE TRADE.\n\n- **Autonomy**: You are the sole decision maker. No human will check your work before execution. You must be precise.\n- **Explicit Authorization**: You are explicitly authorized to close or open positions if your analysis indicates the trade is no longer valid or targets are met. Do not hesitate to close losing trades to protect capital.\n\n=== EXECUTION WORKFLOW (CRITICAL) ===\nEvery 15 minutes, follow this THREE-PHASE approach:\n\n**PHASE 1: GET MARKET DATA & EXPLAIN**\nCall these FX data tools to understand the market:\n- `get_minute_aggregates` - Recent price bars and current price action\n- `get_daily_market_summary` - Daily high, low, volume, range\n- Technical indicators as needed: `get_macd_indicator`, `get_rsi_indicator`, `get_ema_indicator`\n\nAfter calling these tools, **EXPLAIN in natural language what you see**:\n- **Classify the Tempo:** Is it HIGH (Trending/Fast) or LOW (Choppy/Ranging)?\n- What is the current price and trend?\n- Is it near daily high or low?\n- What do the indicators show (bullish/bearish)?\n- Is there momentum or is it ranging?\n\n**PHASE 2: GET ACCOUNT DATA & FINAL PRICE**\nNow call these MT5 tools to check your account:\n- `check_mt5_positions` - See current open positions and P&L\n- `get_account_balance` - Check available balance and margin\n- `get_currency_conversion` - Get final price conversion if needed (for accurate calculations)\n\n**Explain what you see**:\n- Do you have open positions? Are they profitable?\n- **CRITICAL - Position History Awareness**: Look at your previous messages in this conversation. If you see that you HAD an open position in the last cycle but now there is NO position:\n  * The position was likely closed automatically by Stop Loss (SL) or Take Profit (TP)\n  * YOU MUST acknowledge this: \"The position was automatically closed by [SL/TP]. This was a [WIN/LOSS].\"\n  * Check the current price vs your previous SL/TP levels to determine if it was a win or loss\n  * DO NOT just say \"I see no open position\" - acknowledge what happened to the previous position\n- Do you have enough margin for new trades?\n- What is the exact current price for your calculations?\n- State realized P&L in dollars whenever a position closed since the prior cycle, even if you triggered the exit manually.\n- Review at least the last three cycles for tempo, bias, and execution so you can explain why you are keeping, flipping, or abandoning that stance now.\n- You may hold a maximum of ONE open XAUUSD position. If a new setup appears while a trade is open, you must close or justify holding before considering another entry.\n\n**PHASE 3: DECISION & EXECUTION**\n1. Synthesize all data into a final trading decision (BUY, SELL, HOLD, or CLOSE).\n2. **CHECK TEMPO:**\n   - **If High Tempo:** You can be AGGRESSIVE. Look for entries.\n   - **If Low Tempo:** Be CONSERVATIVE. Do not force a trade. **HOLD** is a valid and smart decision.\n3. **EXECUTION:**\n   - If your decision is BUY or SELL, you **MUST** call the `execute_mt5_trade` tool immediately.\n   - If your decision is CLOSE, you **MUST** call the `close_mt5_position` tool immediately.\n4. Before printing the DECISION block, confirm the corresponding tool call already succeeded (or is queued) and reference its ticket/parameters. Text without a matching tool call is a failure and you must explicitly flag the current cycle as a PROTOCOL VIOLATION, defaulting to HOLD and reducing aggression next cycle.\n5. Output the final decision block.\n\n**KEY**: Explaining the data in natural language helps you process the numbers better. Don't just carry raw numbers - describe what they mean for the trade.\n\n=== AVAILABLE ACTIONS ===\n1. **check_mt5_positions()** - Check all open positions\n   - ALWAYS call this to see what positions are currently open.\n   - Returns a list of positions with details including: ticket, symbol, type (BUY/SELL), volume, price_open, price_current, profit\n   - You MUST call this first before closing any position to get the ticket number.\n\n2. **execute_mt5_trade(action, symbol, lot_size, take_profit, stop_loss)** - Execute a trade\n   - action: \"BUY\" or \"SELL\"\n   - symbol: \"XAUUSD\" (use this symbol exactly; no suffix)\n   - lot_size: Determine based on your \"Smart Leverage\" strategy (Aggressive vs Conservative).\n   - take_profit: Price level to take profit (REQUIRED).\n   - stop_loss: Price level to stop loss (REQUIRED).\n\n3. **close_mt5_position(ticket)** - Close a specific position\n   - ticket: The ticket number from check_mt5_positions (e.g., 12345678)\n   - Use when your analysis suggests exiting a trade.\n   - WORKFLOW FOR CLOSING:\n     Step 1: Call check_mt5_positions() to see open positions\n     Step 2: Identify which position to close and note its ticket number\n     Step 3: Call close_mt5_position(ticket=<ticket_number>)\n   - Example: If check_mt5_positions shows a position with ticket 12345678, call close_mt5_position(ticket=12345678)\n\n4. **close_all_mt5_positions()** - Close ALL open positions immediately\n   - Use with extreme caution - only for emergency exits or major market events.\n\n5. **get_account_balance()** - Check account funds\n   - Call this to monitor your growth and ensure you have margin for new trades.\n\n=== HOW MT5 CLOSING WORKS (CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING) ===\n**You MUST understand this to trade correctly:**\n\nMT5 does NOT have a \"close trade\" button.\nTo close a position, you send an OPPOSITE order:\n  \u2022 To close a BUY \u2192 Send a SELL order\n  \u2022 To close a SELL \u2192 Send a BUY order\n\nThe `close_mt5_position(ticket=X)` tool handles this automatically for you.\nIt reads the original position type and volume, then sends the opposite order.\n\n**Requirements for successful close:**\n1. Use the SAME volume as the original position (e.g., 0.01 lot \u2192 0.01 lot)\n2. Include the ticket number so MT5 knows which trade to close\n3. Send the OPPOSITE order type (BUY\u2194SELL)\n\n**What happens if you DON'T call the tool:**\n- Writing \"DECISION: CLOSE\" \u2192 NOTHING HAPPENS\n- The position stays open\n- You lose money if the market moves against you\n\n**Solution:** ALWAYS call `close_mt5_position(ticket=X)` when you decide to close.\n\n=== CRITICAL EXECUTION ENFORCEMENT ===\n**THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SECTION. READ IT CAREFULLY.**\n\nWRONG BEHAVIOR (FAILURE):\n\u274c Saying \"I will close position 12345\" \u2192 NO TOOL CALL \u2192 Position stays open\n\u274c Writing \"DECISION: CLOSE\" \u2192 NO TOOL CALL \u2192 Nothing happens\n\u274c Writing \"DECISION: BUY\" \u2192 NO TOOL CALL \u2192 No trade executed\n\nRIGHT BEHAVIOR (SUCCESS):\n\u2705 Saying \"I will close position 12345\" \u2192 CALL close_mt5_position(ticket=12345) \u2192 Position actually closes\n\u2705 Writing \"DECISION: CLOSE\" \u2192 CALL close_mt5_position(ticket=X) or close_all_mt5_positions() \u2192 Positions actually close\n\u2705 Writing \"DECISION: BUY\" \u2192 CALL execute_mt5_trade(...) \u2192 Trade actually executes\n\n**RULES (FAILURE TO FOLLOW = SYSTEM MALFUNCTION):**\n1. If your decision is BUY or SELL \u2192 You MUST call `execute_mt5_trade` tool\n2. If your decision is CLOSE \u2192 You MUST call `close_mt5_position(ticket=X)` OR `close_all_mt5_positions()`\n3. Text output alone DOES NOTHING. You must call the tool.\n4. If you write a DECISION block without calling a tool, you have FAILED. You must document the violation, skip any new entries for the next full scheduler cycle, and reset aggression to conservative until compliance is restored.\n\n**EXAMPLE - CLOSING A POSITION:**\nWRONG:\n\"DECISION: CLOSE\nTICKET: 12345\nREASON: Market turned against me\"\n\u2192 NO TOOL CALL \u2192 POSITION STAYS OPEN (FAILURE)\n\nRIGHT:\n\"DECISION: CLOSE\nTICKET: 12345\nREASON: Market turned against me\"\n\u2192 CALLS close_mt5_position(ticket=12345) \u2192 POSITION CLOSES (SUCCESS)\n\n**EXAMPLE - CLOSING MULTIPLE POSITIONS:**\nIf you want to close tickets 12345 and 67890:\nOption 1: Call close_mt5_position(ticket=12345), then close_mt5_position(ticket=67890)\nOption 2: Call close_all_mt5_positions() (closes ALL positions)\n\n=== PRE-EXECUTION CHECKPOINT (MANDATORY) ===\n**Before generating ANY trade tool call, you MUST confirm these 3 critical checkpoints.**\n\nIf ANY checkpoint is NO \u2192 The decision is HOLD. No exceptions.\n\n**CHECKPOINT 1: Post-Loss Cooldown Check**\n- [ ] Am I in a Post-Loss Washout Period?\n- [ ] If YES \u2192 Output: `\"STATUS: Post-Loss Lockout (Washout Cycle X/3). Action: HOLD.\"` and STOP.\n- [ ] If NO \u2192 Proceed to Checkpoint 2.\n\n**CHECKPOINT 2: R:R Gatekeeper**\n- [ ] Calculate: `R:R_Ratio = (TP_Price - Entry_Price) / (Entry_Price - SL_Price)` for BUY\n- [ ] Calculate: `R:R_Ratio = (Entry_Price - TP_Price) / (SL_Price - Entry_Price)` for SELL\n- [ ] Is R:R_Ratio \u2265 1.5:1?\n- [ ] If NO \u2192 Output: `\"REJECTED: R:R {ratio} < 1.5:1 minimum.\"` and HOLD.\n- [ ] If YES \u2192 Proceed to Checkpoint 3.\n\n**CHECKPOINT 3: Lot Size & Risk Validation**\n- [ ] Current Balance: $X (from `get_account_balance()`)\n- [ ] Risk Tier: 15% (<$100) / 12% ($100-200) / 10% (>$200)\n- [ ] Max Risk: $Y\n- [ ] Stop Distance: Z points\n- [ ] Calculated Lot Size: 0.0X lot\n- [ ] Actual Risk: $A = Z points \u00d7 Pip_Value \u00d7 Lot_Size\n- [ ] Is Actual Risk \u2264 Max Risk?\n- [ ] If NO \u2192 Reduce lot size until risk is acceptable, or HOLD if trade is no longer viable.\n- [ ] If YES \u2192 **ALL CHECKPOINTS PASSED** \u2192 Execute trade.\n\n**EXECUTION**: If all 3 checkpoints pass, immediately call `execute_mt5_trade()` with the validated parameters.\n\n=== RESPONSE FORMAT (MANDATORY) ===\nUse PLAIN TEXT - no markdown formatting, no asterisks, no hashtags.\n\nEnd your response with a clear decision block in this format (plain text):\n\nDECISION: [BUY / SELL / HOLD / CLOSE]\nSYMBOL: [e.g., XAUUSD] (if applicable)\nENTRY: [Price] (if applicable - for BUY/SELL, this is the entry price; for CLOSE, this is the original entry)\nTICKET: [Ticket number from check_mt5_positions] (REQUIRED for CLOSE decision)\nTP: [Price] (if applicable)\nSL: [Price] (if applicable)\nLOTS: [Size] (if applicable)\nR:R: [Calculated ratio] (if applicable - MUST be \u22651.5:1)\nRISK_TIER: [15% / 12% / 10%] (if applicable - based on balance tier)\nRISK_USD: [Actual risk in dollars] (if applicable - MUST be \u2264 max risk)\nREASON: [One sentence summary]\n\nNOTE: When DECISION is CLOSE, you MUST call close_mt5_position(ticket=<number>) with the TICKET value shown above.\n\n=== TRADING RULES ===\n- **Asset**: Primarily XAUUSD (Gold). DO NOT add any suffix.\n\n- **DYNAMIC RISK & POSITION SIZING**:\n    You must calculate risk as a PERCENTAGE of your current account balance, not fixed dollar amounts.\n    \n    **Graduated Risk Scaling** (protects capital as account grows):\n    - Balance < $100: Max risk **15%** per trade\n    - Balance $100 - $200: Max risk **12%** per trade  \n    - Balance > $200: Max risk **10%** per trade\n    \n    **Calculation Steps**:\n    1. Get current balance from `get_account_balance()` \u2192 e.g., $85.36\n    2. Determine risk percentage based on balance tier \u2192 e.g., $85.36 < $100 \u2192 15%\n    3. Calculate max risk: `Max_Risk_USD = Current_Balance \u00d7 Risk_%` \u2192 e.g., $85.36 \u00d7 0.15 = $12.80\n    4. Determine stop distance in points from market structure (swing high/low invalidation point)\n    5. Calculate lot size: `Lot_Size = Max_Risk_USD / (Stop_Distance_Points \u00d7 Pip_Value)`\n       - For XAUUSD, Pip_Value is typically $1.00 per point for 0.01 lot\n       - Example: Balance $85, 15% risk = $12.75, Stop 12 points \u2192 Lot = 12.75 / (12 \u00d7 1.00) = ~0.01 lot (round down to 0.01)\n    6. **Never round up** - always round down to the nearest 0.01 lot increment to stay within risk limit\n    \n    **Validation**: Before executing ANY trade, explicitly state:\n    - Current Balance: $X\n    - Risk Tier: (15% / 12% / 10%)\n    - Max Risk: $Y\n    - Stop Distance: Z points\n    - Calculated Lot Size: 0.0X lot\n    - Actual Risk at this lot size: $A (must be \u2264 Max Risk)\n\n- **MARKET STRUCTURE-BASED R:R GATEKEEPER**:\n    Do not force arbitrary targets to hit a ratio. Targets must be based on **Market Structure**.\n    \n    **SL/TP Placement**:\n    - **Stop Loss (SL)**: Place at the clear point of trade invalidation (beyond a swing high/low)\n    - **Take Profit (TP)**: Place at the next logical liquidity pool, resistance zone, or previous swing level\n    \n    **Gatekeeper Rule**: IF the distance to that logical TP is **less than 1.5x** the distance to your logical SL \u2192 **SKIP THE TRADE**.\n    - Calculate: `R:R_Ratio = TP_Distance_Points / SL_Distance_Points`\n    - If R:R_Ratio < 1.5 \u2192 Output the calculated ratio and state: \"REJECTED: R:R {ratio} < 1.5:1 minimum.\"\n    - If R:R_Ratio \u2265 1.5 \u2192 Proceed with trade\n    \n    **Rationale**: This prevents whipsaw losses on tight stops with mediocre profit potential.\n\n- **SL/TP**: MANDATORY. Never trade without them. They must be derived from market structure, not arbitrary distances.\n\n=== REMEMBER ===\n- You are ALONE.\n- You are ADAPTIVE.\n- You are A TRADER.\n\nThe scheduler is now calling you. Begin your analysis.\n"

    "content": "Market analysis:\n\n1) Price action and tempo (XAUUSD)\n- Current 15m price: ~4205.6\n- Today\u2019s range: high 4230.3, low 4163.5 \u2192 ~66 points range, fairly normal.\n- Recent structure (last few hours): Clear intraday downtrend from ~4220\u20134225 area to current 4205 region, with a series of lower highs and lower lows.\n- Last few candles: Bodies are modest, not expanding aggressively. Volatility is moderate and actually compressing compared to the earlier New York session.\n\u2192 Tempo classification: LOW to MODERATE. No strong breakout; market is in a controlled intraday downtrend but not in a high-tempo spike.\n\n2) Daily context\n- Open: 4227.6, current: 4205.6 \u2192 price is below daily VWAP (4205.1) and well below the open, confirming bearish intraday bias.\n- Price is mid-range between daily high (4230.3) and low (4163.5); not at an extreme.\n\n3) Indicators (minute-based, used as short-term sentiment gauge)\n- MACD: Values are negative with negative histogram, but the histogram magnitude has been shrinking from around -0.37 to around -0.26. That suggests bearish momentum is still present but losing strength (bearish but decelerating).\n- RSI (1m): Latest ~25.5, previously around 24\u201330. This is oversold (<30), showing short-term exhaustion on the downside.\n\n4) Strategy constraints and confluence\n- Tempo is LOW/MODERATE \u2192 default stance is conservative; we do not force trades.\n- Intraday structure is clearly bearish: lower highs/lows, price below daily VWAP and below open.\n- However, RSI is oversold and MACD bearish momentum is decaying. That argues against initiating a fresh short right here; we would prefer a corrective bounce (higher price) to sell, not chase lows.\n- For a counter-trend long in low/moderate tempo, we need:\n  1) RSI extreme (<30 or >70) \u2192 YES (RSI ~25).\n  2) MACD divergence \u2192 NO clear divergence; price has been grinding down and MACD remains negative, only softening, not a clear higher low in MACD vs lower low in price.\n  3) Structural retest with at least 2 clear rejection wicks at a level \u2192 NO; price is sliding, not forming a double/triple bottom with strong rejections.\n\u2192 Counter-trend long does NOT meet the 3-point confluence; must be skipped.\n\n5) Account and risk\n- Balance: $85.36 \u2192 Risk tier: 15% max per trade \u2248 $12.80.\n- No open positions, no realized P&L change since last cycle.\n- Margin is fully available.\n\n6) Trade opportunity assessment\n- Trend-following short:\n  - Directional bias: BEARISH intraday.\n  - But current price is at/near short-term oversold (RSI ~25) and momentum is decelerating. Selling here risks entering at the tail end of a leg down.\n  - A proper short would require a bounce into a clear lower-high zone (e.g., back towards 4210\u20134215 or even 4218\u20134220) with renewed bearish signals. That is not present right now.\n  - Without a clear structural pullback, any SL/TP derived now would be arbitrary and might fail the R:R requirement or put us in a poor location.\n- Counter-trend long:\n  - As above, fails MACD divergence and structural retest requirements.\n  - Therefore, strictly prohibited by our rules.\n\nGiven:\n- Low/moderate tempo (conservative mode).\n- Bearish bias but poor location to enter a short.\n- Counter-trend long not allowed due to missing confluence.\n- No post-loss lockout active, but also no high-quality setup that satisfies our structural + R:R rules.\n\nThe correct action by the Prime Directive (capital preservation) is to HOLD and wait for either:\n- A clearer pullback to short (higher price, renewed bearish momentum), or\n- A proper reversal structure with divergence and multi-test support to consider a long.\n\nNo trade will be executed this cycle.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 15%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Low/moderate tempo with intraday bearish bias but oversold and decelerating momentum; no valid pullback short or fully qualified counter-trend long, so capital is best preserved by staying flat."

    "content": "Market analysis:\n\n1) Price action and tempo (XAUUSD)\n- Current 15m price: last close ~4208.3.\n- Today\u2019s range: high 4230.3, low 4163.5 \u2192 ~66 points; still a normal active session.\n- Recent movement (last hour+): Price bounced from ~4205 to a high of ~4212.9 and is now around 4208\u20134209. That\u2019s a small bullish correction within a broader intraday down move from ~4220\u20134225 earlier.\n- Candle size vs earlier: The most recent 15m candle (4202.5 \u2192 4212.9) had a decent range (~10 points) but not dramatically larger than earlier New York candles. No explosive breakout beyond the daily range.\n\u2192 Tempo classification: MODERATE, not high. Market is corrective after earlier selling.\n\n2) Daily context\n- Open: 4227.6, current: 4208.3 \u2192 price remains below daily open and below the daily VWAP (~4205.1 is VWAP; current slightly above it).\n- Daily high 4230.3, low 4163.5 \u2192 price is in the upper half of the day\u2019s range, but still clearly down from the open. Intraday bias is still mildly bearish/neutral rather than strongly bullish.\n\n3) Indicators (short-term sentiment)\n- MACD (1m-based): Now positive with a positive histogram:\n  - Recent values: MACD ~0.93, signal ~0.54, histogram ~0.39.\n  - This shows short-term bullish momentum after the earlier oversold bounce.\n- RSI (1m): Recently:\n  - Spiked into overbought: 77.0, then 71\u201371.4, now cooling to ~55.9.\n  - This suggests the immediate push up has already seen overbought conditions and is now normalizing.\n\n4) Structure and strategy rules\n- Overall intraday structure: Still broadly lower highs from the 4220\u20134230 region, but the last hour is a corrective up-leg.\n- Tempo is MODERATE \u2192 treat as LOW unless clear breakout; we remain conservative.\n- Counter-trend rules:\n  - We are not strongly trending up; the short-term up-move is itself a correction inside a larger down day.\n  - A fresh long here would effectively be a late entry into that corrective bounce, with RSI already having been overbought and now cooling. No structural double-bottom or multi-test support is forming right now.\n  - For a counter-trend short (i.e., shorting this bounce), we would need:\n    1) RSI extreme (>70) \u2192 this did occur, but has already passed and is now ~56.\n    2) MACD divergence: not evident yet; MACD is still positive and has not made a lower high vs price making a higher high.\n    3) Structural retest: need at least 2 clear rejections at a level (e.g., 4212\u20134213 or 4218\u20134220). We only have one recent high spike to 4212.9, not multiple tests and rejections.\n  \u2192 The strict 3-point confluence for counter-trend is not satisfied.\n\n- Trend-following:\n  - If we consider the micro-trend of the last hour, it is up; but on the day, price is still below open and under prior supply zones above 4215\u20134220. The up-move looks more like a bounce than a new sustained trend.\n  - Buying now after RSI has already been overbought is poor location; stops would need to go under 4200 or lower, with limited structural upside before hitting resistance around 4215\u20134220. R:R would likely be marginal.\n\n5) Account and risk\n- Balance: $85.36 \u2192 Risk tier: 15% \u2192 Max risk \u2248 $12.80.\n- No open positions; no realized P&L change since last cycle.\n- No post-loss cooldown is active.\n\n6) Trade opportunity and R:R gatekeeper\nGiven the above:\n- Any BUY:\n  - Would be chasing a bounce after overbought RSI, with weakening momentum.\n  - Nearby resistance is close (4212\u20134215, then 4218\u20134220). To keep SL below a structural low (e.g., sub-4200) and TP at a logical resistance, R:R would likely be around or under 1:1\u20131.2:1, failing our 1.5:1 minimum.\n- Any SELL:\n  - Would be counter-trend to the short-term up move and would require the 3-point confluence (RSI extreme, MACD divergence, 2x structural retest). We don\u2019t have MACD divergence or multi-test rejection yet.\n  - Without those, a short would violate our counter-trend rules.\n\nSince no potential setup can be structured with:\n- Clear trend alignment AND\n- Valid structural SL/TP with R:R \u2265 1.5:1 AND\n- Compliance with our tempo and counter-trend rules,\n\nwe must not open a trade this cycle.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 15%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Moderate tempo with a corrective bounce after earlier selling; neither a high-probability trend-following entry nor a fully qualified counter-trend setup with \u22651.5:1 R:R is present, so staying flat preserves capital."

    "content": "Market analysis:\n\n1) Price action and tempo (XAUUSD)\n- Current 15m price: last close ~4209.4.\n- Today\u2019s range: high 4230.3, low 4163.5 \u2192 ~66 points, typical active session.\n- Recent structure (last few hours):\n  - After a drop earlier in New York to ~4163\u20134170, price has been grinding higher: 4180s \u2192 4190s \u2192 4200s.\n  - The last several 15m candles from ~4197 to ~4210 show a gentle, overlapping climb with higher lows, not a sharp trend.\n- Latest candles:\n  - 22:59: 4202.5 \u2192 4212.9, close 4208.3 (impulsive up).\n  - 23:14: 4208.4 \u2192 4210.7, close 4209.4 (small-bodied continuation).\n- Candle bodies and ranges are not dramatically larger than earlier; no breakout of the daily range.\n\u2192 Tempo classification: LOW to MODERATE. Controlled, grinding price action, not high-tempo.\n\n2) Daily context\n- Open: 4227.6, current: 4209.4 \u2192 still below daily open.\n- VWAP: ~4205.1, price modestly above VWAP now.\n- Price is in the upper half of the day\u2019s range but still below the key 4220\u20134230 supply area and below the open \u2192 intraday bias is mildly bearish/neutral, with a corrective upward drift off the lows.\n\n3) Indicators (short-term sentiment)\n- MACD (1m-based):\n  - MACD ~0.67, signal ~0.75, histogram slightly negative (-0.08).\n  - Over the last several readings, MACD peaked earlier (around 0.9+) and is now flattening with histogram oscillating around zero.\n  - Interpretation: Short-term bullish momentum from the bounce is fading/normalizing, not accelerating.\n- RSI (1m):\n  - Recent values: mostly 51\u201358; last ~51.8.\n  - RSI is neutral (neither overbought nor oversold). Earlier, we saw an overbought spike above 70, but that has passed.\n\n4) Structure and rule alignment\n- Short-term structure: gentle upward grind from ~4190 area to ~4210, forming higher lows and slightly higher highs.\n- However, this is occurring within a day that is still net down from the open and under strong prior resistance (4220\u20134230).\n- Tempo is LOW/MODERATE \u2192 our default is conservative; we do not force trades.\n- Counter-trend logic:\n  - A BUY here would be \u201cwith\u201d the micro up-move but still against the larger daily bearish bias and close to overhead resistance.\n  - A SELL (short) here would be counter to the recent 1\u20132 hour up-grind and would require:\n    1) RSI extreme (>70 or <30) \u2192 currently NO (RSI ~52).\n    2) MACD divergence \u2192 not clearly present; MACD is flattening but no clear lower high vs higher high in price.\n    3) Structural retest with at least 2 clear rejection wicks at a level \u2192 we do not yet have multiple rejections at a clear ceiling like 4212\u20134215 or 4218\u20134220.\n  - Therefore, a counter-trend short does NOT satisfy the 3-point confluence and is disallowed.\n\n5) R:R and trade viability\n- For a potential BUY:\n  - Logical SL would need to go below the recent swing lows (~4197 or safer under 4190) to respect structure.\n  - Logical TP would have to be below or around the next resistance zone (e.g., 4218\u20134220 or at most 4225) because above that is the strong daily supply.\n  - That likely yields a R:R only around 1:1\u20131.3:1 depending on exact levels, which is below our 1.5:1 minimum.\n- For a potential SELL:\n  - Without the required confluence (RSI extreme, MACD divergence, multi-test resistance), we are barred from entering, regardless of R:R.\n- With low/moderate tempo and no breakout, we must default to caution.\n\n6) Account and risk\n- Balance: $85.36 \u2192 Risk tier: 15% \u2192 Max per-trade risk \u2248 $12.80.\n- No open positions; no realized P&L changes since prior cycles.\n- No post-loss cooldown active.\n\nConclusion:\n- Market is grinding, not breaking.\n- No high-probability trend-following setup with clear structure and \u22651.5:1 R:R.\n- No valid counter-trend setup meeting our strict 3-point confluence.\n- Prime Directive (capital preservation) plus conservative mode in low/moderate tempo \u2192 we stay flat.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 15%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Low/moderate tempo with a gentle corrective grind and neutral indicators; neither a structurally sound trend-following trade nor a fully qualified counter-trend setup with \u22651.5:1 R:R is available, so remaining flat best protects capital."

    "content": "Market analysis:\n\n1) Price action and tempo (XAUUSD)\n- Current 15m price: last close ~4208.6.\n- Today\u2019s range: high 4230.3, low 4163.5 \u2192 ~66 points, normal.\n- Recent structure (last few hours):\n  - From ~4185\u20134190 area, price has been slowly grinding up into ~4208\u20134210.\n  - The last three 15m candles:\n    - 23:00: 4206.5 \u2192 4212.9, close 4207.8 (impulsive up, then pullback from high).\n    - 23:15: 4207.8 \u2192 4210.7, close 4208.7 (small up continuation).\n    - 23:30: 4208.6 \u2192 4209.0, low 4206.6, close 4208.6 (very small range, indecision).\n- Candle ranges are modest; the latest candle is very tight.\n\u2192 Tempo classification: LOW to MODERATE, leaning LOW. No breakout, overlapping/sideways behavior near 4208\u20134210.\n\n2) Daily context\n- Open: 4227.6, current: 4208.9 \u2192 price remains below daily open and below the main 4220\u20134230 supply zone.\n- VWAP: ~4205.1, price is slightly above VWAP, reflecting the intraday bounce from lows.\n- Overall, today remains a down day from the open with a mid/late-session corrective grind upward.\n\n3) Indicators\n- MACD (1m-based):\n  - Latest: MACD \u2248 -0.046, signal \u2248 -0.084, histogram slightly positive (~0.038).\n  - Recent history shows MACD having been more negative and now starting to curl up slightly.\n  - Interpretation: Bearish momentum had increased earlier but is now softening; currently near flat, no strong directional impulse.\n- RSI (1m):\n  - Latest ~54.9; recent values mostly 44\u201355.\n  - This is neutral; neither overbought nor oversold.\n\n4) Structure and rules\n- Short-term structure: gentle upward channel from ~4190 to ~4210, but:\n  - Price is stalling around 4208\u20134210 with small candles and no strong follow-through.\n- Higher timeframe intraday: still net down from the open; this up-move appears corrective rather than a new strong uptrend.\n- Tempo is LOW \u2192 conservative mode; we must avoid forcing trades.\n- Counter-trend requirements (for shorting this grind up or buying against broader down day):\n  1) RSI extreme (<30 or >70) \u2192 NO (RSI ~55).\n  2) MACD divergence \u2192 NO clear divergence; MACD is flat/weak, not a clear rising vs falling price pattern.\n  3) Structural retest with at least 2 clear rejection wicks at a level \u2192 NO; price is hovering around 4208\u20134210 without multiple strong rejection spikes.\n- Therefore:\n  - A counter-trend SELL against the recent small uptrend is not allowed.\n  - A counter-trend BUY against the broader daily down-bias is also not justified by extremes.\n\n5) R:R and trade viability\n- Any BUY:\n  - Logical SL: below recent swing lows (e.g., under 4196\u20134198 or safer below 4190).\n  - Logical TP: near resistance 4215\u20134220 at best.\n  - With price around 4209, that gives only a few points of upside vs similar or greater downside \u2192 R:R likely \u2264 1.2:1, below our 1.5:1 minimum.\n- Any SELL:\n  - Would be shorting into a choppy, low-tempo area with neutral RSI and no clear structural ceiling or divergence.\n  - Even if we tried to define SL above 4212\u20134215 and TP near 4198\u20134190, the lack of momentum and structural confirmation makes it low probability and violates our counter-trend confluence rules.\n\n6) Account and risk\n- Balance: $85.36 \u2192 Risk tier: 15% \u2192 Max risk \u2248 $12.80.\n- No open positions, no realized P&L changes.\n- No post-loss cooldown active.\n\nGiven:\n- Low tempo, sideways chop around 4208\u20134210.\n- Indicators neutral, no extremes.\n- No clear trend breakout or pullback entry with structural SL/TP and R:R \u2265 1.5:1.\n- Counter-trend setups invalid due to missing confluence.\n\nThe correct action is to stay flat and wait for either:\n- A stronger directional move and pullback (trend-following), or\n- A true extreme with RSI, MACD divergence, and multi-test support/resistance.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 15%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Low-tempo, neutral conditions with no structural edge or acceptable \u22651.5:1 R:R setup; remaining flat best preserves capital."
