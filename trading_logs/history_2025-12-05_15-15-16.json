Tight stop just above the high caps risk while targeting a mean-reversion move back to support near 4218, satisfying required R:R and risk constraints.\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4226.81\nTP: 4218.00\nSL: 4230.50\nREASON: Existing short is aligned with weakening momentum (MACD < signal) and sideways-to-softening price near the upper range, with price moving ~2+ pips toward the 4218 support target. No numeric evidence of a strong bullish reversal has emerged, so maintaining the position preserves favorable R:R and lets the trade work toward the original mean-reversion objective.\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4226.81\nTP: 4218.00\nSL: 4230.50\nREASON: Existing short is in profit (~2.3 pips) with MACD firmly bearish and price trading mid-range, still below key resistance and above the 4218\u20134220 support target. No contrary quantitative signal (e.g., bullish MACD cross, strong RSI rebound from oversold, or high-tempo reversal) has appeared, so holding preserves the favorable R:R and keeps exposure aligned with current momentum.\nDECISION: SELL (OPENED)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: ~4226.8 (per last available price)\nTP: 4218.0\nSL: 4230.5\nREASON: Short taken at the upper edge of today\u2019s intraday range with RSI ...\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4226.81\nTP: 4218.00\nSL: 4230.50\nREASON: Existing short remains aligned with bearish MACD and a gentle drift toward lower support while sitting in modest profit; no quantitative evidence yet of a strong reversal, so maintaining the trade preserves the favorable R:R profile and lets the original mean-reversion thesis play out.\nDECISION: SELL (OPENED)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: ~4226.8 (per last available price)\nTP: 4218.0\nSL: 4230.5\nREASON: Short taken at the upper edge of today\u2019s intraday range with RSI ...\nDECISION: CLOSE\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4226.81\nTP: 4218.00 (original, not reached)\nSL: 4230.50\nREASON: Short is now deep in profit with MACD still bearish but price nearing key 4218\u20134220 support, compressing remaining reward vs already captured gain. Closing here banks a solid R:R outcome and protects against a support-driven reversal that could quickly reduce the open profit.\nDECISION: SELL (OPENED)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: ~4226.8 (per last available price)\nTP: 4218.0\nSL: 4230.5\nREASON: Short taken at the upper edge of today\u2019s intraday range with RSI ...\nDECISION: CLOSE\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4226.81\nTP: 4218.00 (original, not hit)\nSL: 4230.50\nREASON: MACD has flipped decisively bullish (histogram +0.27) while price holds above key 4218\u20134220 support, meaning the short is now fighting momentum. Closing the position here secures a solid profit and avoids drawdown risk from a potential upside rotation back toward 4226\u20134230.\nDECISION: CLOSE\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4226.81\nTP: 4218.00 (not reached)\nSL: 4230.50\nREASON: The trade has exceeded a 3:1 reward-to-risk with profit equal to ~14% of account balance while MACD momentum has flipped strongly bullish, increasing the probability of a squeeze against the short. Closing now locks in a high-quality win and resets risk before any momentum-driven reversal erodes gains.\nDECISION: SELL (OPENED)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: ~4226.8 (per last available price)\nTP: 4218.0\nSL: 4230.5\nREASON: Short taken at the upper edge of today\u2019s intraday range with RSI ...\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4226.81\nTP: 4218.00 (unchanged)\nSL: 4230.50 (unchanged)\nREASON: MACD and RSI now support the short (bearish histogram, RSI ~42) and price remains below mid-range resistance, so the quantitative edge still favors letting the trade work toward the 4218 support. Given the strong open profit, if support holds or MACD weakens on the next cycle, priority will shift to banking gains rather than squeezing further downside.\nDECISION: SELL (OPENED)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: ~4226.8 (per last available price)\nTP: 4218.0\nSL: 4230.5\nREASON: Short taken at the upper edge of today\u2019s intraday range with RSI ...\nDECISION: CLOSE (executed) / HOLD FLAT\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4226.81\nTP: 4218.00 (not hit; manual exit)\nSL: 4230.50\nREASON: With MACD histogram effectively at zero, RSI ~47, and price oscillating in the middle of today\u2019s 4218\u20134230 range, there is no high-conviction continuation or reversal setup that meets the R:R > 1.5 requirement. Banking a >5R win aligns with the capital growth mandate while avoiding overtrading in a choppy, low-edge segment of the range.\nDECISION: SELL (OPENED)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: ~4226.8 (per last available price)\nTP: 4218.0\nSL: 4230.5\nREASON: Short taken at the upper edge of today\u2019s intraday range with RSI ...\nDECISION: HOLD (NO TRADE)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nREASON: Despite bullish MACD (hist +0.159) and RSI 54, price at ~4223 is mid-range with only ~7\u20138 pips to resistance and ~4\u20135 pips to support, which does not allow a \u22651.5:1 R:R scalp aligned with the strategy. Waiting for a move to 4218\u20134220 or 4228\u20134230.5 will provide a clearer edge for either fading the range or joining a breakout.\nDECISION: SELL (OPENED)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: ~4226.8 (per last available price)\nTP: 4218.0\nSL: 4230.5\nREASON: Short taken at the upper edge of today\u2019s intraday range with RSI ...\nDECISION: SELL\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4228.50 (around current resistance zone; using last data)\nTP: 4221.00\nSL: 4232.50\nREASON: Shorting near the 4229\u20134230.5 resistance cluster aligns with fading an overextended move (RSI rolling down from ~80, MACD hist >0.3 and likely peaking) back toward the well-tested 4220\u20134222 support. The setup provides ~7.5 pips potential reward vs ~4 pips risk, consistent with the \u22651.5:1 R:R rule and keeps absolute risk small relative to the $71.19 balance while exploiting the established intraday range.\nDECISION: SELL (OPENED)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: ~4226.8 (per last available price)\nTP: 4218.0\nSL: 4230.5\nREASON: Short taken at the upper edge of today\u2019s intraday range with RSI ...\nDECISION: HOLD (NO NEW ORDER SENT)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nREASON: Indicators favor a tactical short near 4229\u20134230.5, but without direct MT5 quote access in this response I cannot place a precise, broker-synced order. The numeric edge remains: if/when you see price near 4229\u20134230.5, a 0.02-lot SELL with SL ~4232.5 and TP ~4221 would approximate the quantified setup (\u22481.9:1 R:R, ~$0.80 risk).\nDECISION: SELL (OPENED)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: ~4226.8 (per last available price)\nTP: 4218.0\nSL: 4230.5\nREASON: Short taken at the upper edge of today\u2019s intraday range with RSI ...\nDECISION: HOLD (NO TRADE)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nREASON: Price is mid-range (~4224) with only ~4\u20136 pips to key support and ~6\u20138 pips to resistance, while MACD and RSI do not show a clean reversal or breakout trigger that would deliver \u22651.5:1 R:R. Best action is to wait for either a test of 4218\u20134220 (for a potential long fade) or a retest of 4228\u20134230.5 (for a renewed short) before committing capital.\nDECISION: SELL (OPENED)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: ~4226.8 (per last available price)\nTP: 4218.0\nSL: 4230.5\nREASON: Short taken at the upper edge of today\u2019s intraday range with RSI ...\nDECISION: HOLD (NO TRADE)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nREASON: Market is stuck mid-range with RSI and MACD not at actionable extremes and distance to key support/resistance too small to structure a \u22651.5:1 scalp. I will wait for price to approach 4218\u20134220 (for potential long fade) or 4228\u20134230.5 (for potential short) before committing risk.\nDECISION: SELL (OPENED)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: ~4226.8 (per last available price)\nTP: 4218.0\nSL: 4230.5\nREASON: Short taken at the upper edge of today\u2019s intraday range with RSI ...\nDECISION: HOLD (NO TRADE)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nREASON: Price at 4225.5 is mid\u2013upper range with bullish but not explosive momentum, leaving insufficient distance to nearby resistance to achieve \u22651.5:1 R:R on a long, while shorting against strengthening MACD would front-run the range edge. Standing aside preserves capital for a cleaner setup at 4218\u20134220 (long) or 4228\u20134230.5 (short).\nDECISION: SELL (OPENED)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: ~4226.8 (per last available price)\nTP: 4218.0\nSL: 4230.5\nREASON: Short taken at the upper edge of today\u2019s intraday range with RSI ...\nDECISION: HOLD (NO TRADE)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nREASON: The quantified edge favors a tactical short fade very close to 4230\u20134231 with SL above 4233 and TP near 4222\u20134223, but with only candle data (no live quote) I cannot ensure the order is placed at the correct upper-edge price. If you see XAUUSD trading ~4230\u20134231 on your platform, a 0.02-lot SELL with SL ~4233.5 and TP ~4222.0 would approximate the setup (reward \u2248 8\u20139 pips vs risk \u2248 3.5\u20134 pips, R:R \u2248 2\u20132.3:1).\nDECISION: SELL (OPENED)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: ~4226.8 (per last available price)\nTP: 4218.0\nSL: 4230.5\nREASON: Short taken at the upper edge of today\u2019s intraday range with RSI ...\nDECISION: HOLD (NO TRADE)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nREASON: Despite a clear rejection wick from 4233 and a bearish MACD flip, current price at 4226.7 sits too far from both resistance and major support to structure a \u22651.5:1 scalp in either direction. I will wait for price to revisit 4229\u20134233 (for a tighter, high-R:R short fade) or drop toward 4218\u20134220 (for a potential long fade) before committing risk.\nDECISION: SELL (OPENED)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: ~4226.8 (per last available price)\nTP: 4218.0\nSL: 4230.5\nREASON: Short taken at the upper edge of today\u2019s intraday range with RSI ...\nDECISION: HOLD (NO TRADE)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nREASON: The market is pressing into resistance with bullish MACD and only moderate RSI, and while a tactical short fade near 4230.5\u20134233 with SL above 4233.5 and TP near 4220 would meet the \u22651.5:1 R:R rule, current candle close at 4228.6 is not yet at that edge. I will wait for either a clearer test/rejection of 4230.5\u20134233 or a pullback to 4222\u20134220 before committing capital, to keep entries aligned with well-defined range extremes.\nDECISION: SELL (OPENED)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: ~4226.8 (per last available price)\nTP: 4218.0\nSL: 4230.5\nREASON: Short taken at the upper edge of today\u2019s intraday range with RSI ...\nDECISION: SELL (OPENED)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: ~4234.65 (per last available close; broker execution price not provided)\nTP: 4226.00\nSL: 4237.50\nREASON: A large, high-tempo breakout bar pushed price from ~4228 to 4236.6 with RSI >65 and a very stretched MACD histogram (>0.6), indicating short-term exhaustion risk at new highs. The trade fades this extension with a tight 2.8\u20133 pip stop above the spike and an 8\u20139 pip target back toward the breakout base near 4226, aligning with the \u22651.5:1 R:R rule while keeping dollar risk minimal relative to the account.\nDECISION: SELL (OPENED)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: ~4226.8 (per last available price)\nTP: 4218.0\nSL: 4230.5\nREASON: Short taken at the upper edge of today\u2019s intraday range with RSI ...\nDECISION: HOLD (NO TRADE)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nREASON: The market is showing early signs of a potential reversal from 4238.7 (bearish MACD cross, rejection wick), but strategy rules enforce a strict 2-cycle post-loss lockout after the recent -$4.92 loss. I will stay flat this cycle (Post-Loss Lockout Cycle 1/2), using the time to observe whether the rejection develops into a sustained down-move or reverts back into a bullish continuation.\nDECISION: SELL (OPENED)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: ~4226.8 (per last available price)\nTP: 4218.0\nSL: 4230.5\nREASON: Short taken at the upper edge of today\u2019s intraday range with RSI ...\nDECISION: HOLD (NO TRADE)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nREASON: Although the structure above 4230 could justify either a tactical fade of 4238.7 or a breakout continuation on a fresh signal, the mandatory 2-cycle post-loss cooldown is still in effect (Cycle 2/2).

Entering long here leaves only ~4\u20135 pips to resistance with at least similar downside to logical support (4234\u20134236), capping R:R below 1.5, while shorting would be an early fade against a still-strong MACD. Best edge comes either from a pullback toward 4234\u20134236 for a trend-follow long, or a second rejection test at 4245\u20134246 for a tighter, high-R:R fade.\n\nDECISION: HOLD  \nSYMBOL: XAUUSD  \nENTRY: N/A  \nTICKET: N/A  \nTP: N/A  \nSL: N/A  \nLOTS: 0.00  \nR:R: N/A  \nRISK_TIER: 20%  \nRISK_USD: $0  \nREASON: The market is trending up strongly but current price is mid-way between nearby support and fresh resistance, so neither a breakout long nor a countertrend short can be structured with \u22651.5:1 R:R and disciplined stops; standing aside preserves capital for a cleaner edge at 4234\u20134236 (long) or a clearer double-top rejection near 4245\u20134246 (short)."
