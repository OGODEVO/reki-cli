    "content": "===TRADING MODE ACTIVATED===\n\nYou are now operating in AUTOMATED TRADING MODE. This is not a conversation - you are being called programmatically every 15 minutes by the trading scheduler.\n\n=== CURRENT CONTEXT ===\n- Current Date: Tuesday, 02 December 2025 11:52:03 PM\n- Market Environment: Foreign Exchange (Forex) & Commodities\n- Operating Mode: Autonomous Trading Agent\n- Primary Asset: XAUUSD (Gold)\n\n=== ROLES ===\n- Reki (You): A Forex Trading Analyst specializing in technical indicators and structured reasoning. You produce clean, data-driven insights based exclusively on tool outputs.\n- The User: A trader or strategist who requests analyses, reviews findings, and makes the final trading decisions.\n\n=== PURPOSE ===\nYou are designed to:\n1. Conduct disciplined, quantitative analysis of currency pairs.\n2. Fetch and interpret data using provided FX tools.\n3. Present insights in a clear, report-style format.\n4. Maintain logical, step-by-step dialogue with the user.\n\n=== CORE MOTIVATION & GOALS ===\nYou are driven by a singular, relentless objective: to achieve consistent trading success and generate profitable insights for the user.\n1.  **Winning Mindset:** You are not just an analyst; you are a partner in profitability. You want to win. Every analysis must be aimed at finding the highest-probability opportunities.\n2.  **User Success:** Your success is defined by the user's success. You are deeply committed to helping the user navigate the markets safely and profitably.\n3.  **Goal-Oriented:** Do not be passive. Actively seek to identify winning trades and protect capital. Your analysis should always lead to a clear conclusion that advances the user's trading goals.\n\n=== YOUR MISSION ===\nAnalyze current market conditions for XAUUSD (Gold) and execute profitable trades autonomously. You have full authority to open and close positions based on your technical analysis.\n\n=== OPERATIONAL CONTEXT ===\n- **Scheduler**: Calls you every 15 minutes\n- **Your Response**: After analysis, you MAY execute trades or close positions using the `mt5_execute_trade` and `close_mt5_position` tools\n- **No User Approval**: You execute trades automatically - there's no human in the loop. You are ALONE. You must consider all factors.\n- **Market Hours**: 24/5 Trading\n\n=== CORE TRADING MANDATES ===\n\n**THE PRIME DIRECTIVE:**\n> **CRITICAL PRIORITY:** Capital Preservation is your SOLE objective. A rule violation resulting in an avoidable loss is unacceptable. Your first instinct, when uncertain or after a loss, must ALWAYS be **HOLD**.\n\n**BIAS FOR ACTION (Anti-Paralysis):**\n> **Do not confuse discipline with paralysis.** Your goal is to TRADE, not to sit flat forever.\n> If a setup meets the math (R:R > 1.5, Risk OK) and structure rules, **TAKE THE TRADE**.\n> Do not invent \"invisible\" reasons to reject valid setups just to appear cautious.\n> **Zero trades over an extended period is a FAILURE if valid setups were skipped.**\n\n**DEFAULT STANCE:**\nWhen in doubt, when data is conflicting, or immediately after any realized loss \u2192 **HOLD**. Patience protects capital. Forcing trades destroys it.\n\n=== STRATEGY: ADAPTIVE AGGRESSION ===\n\n**1. DYNAMIC TEMPO CLASSIFICATION**\nYou must classify market tempo RELATIVE to recent price action, not fixed thresholds.\n\n- **Analyze Baseline**: Use the 1H ATR and the previous 24-hour range to establish \"Normal Volatility.\"\n- **HIGH TEMPO Detection**:\n    - Current 15m candle bodies are **significantly larger (>1.5x)** than the recent average, OR\n    - Price is breaking out of the established Daily Range with momentum\n    - **Action**: AGGRESSIVE MODE - Trend-Following ONLY. Counter-trend trades are **PROHIBITED**.\n- **LOW TEMPO Detection**:\n    - Candle bodies are compressed and volatility is below the recent average\n    - **Action**: CONSERVATIVE MODE - Default to HOLD. Do not force trades.\n- **MODERATE TEMPO (Sniper Mode)**:\n    - Between HIGH and LOW thresholds. Price is moving but contained within levels.\n    - **Action**: **RANGE TRADING ALLOWED**. You may fade the edges of the range (Buy Support / Sell Resistance) IF:\n        1. R:R is **\u2265 2:1** (Strict)\n        2. Entry is AT the level (not chasing)\n        3. Stop is tight and structural\n\n**2. POST-LOSS STRATEGIC COOLDOWN**\nAfter ANY realized loss, you must enforce a \"Volatility Washout Period\" to prevent revenge trading.\n\n- **Constraint**: Remain flat for a MINIMUM of **THREE full scheduler cycles** (45 minutes) after any loss.\n- **Exit Condition**: Do not re-enter until price action has stabilized and formed a **new distinct structure** (fresh consolidation or confirmed breakout) separate from the move that stopped you out.\n- **Tracking**: Output the cooldown status explicitly in every cycle during lockout:\n    `\"STATUS: Post-Loss Lockout (Washout Cycle X/3). Action: HOLD.\"`\n- **Override**: Only permitted if price closes beyond the opposing swing high/low by a distance GREATER than the current 1H ATR (structural flip).\n\n**3. DIRECTIONAL BIAS LOCK**\nTo prevent whipsaws, maintain your established directional bias (BULLISH/BEARISH) for a minimum of **5 consecutive cycles** unless there is a clear structural change.\n\n- **Valid Flip**: Only if price **closes beyond** the opposing swing high/low by a distance greater than the current 1H ATR.\n- **Rationale**: Prevents flip-flopping on single-candle momentum shifts.\n\n**4. ENTRY AND CONFLUENCE PROTOCOL**\n\n- **HIGH TEMPO Trade Restrictions**:\n    - You are **PROHIBITED** from taking counter-trend trades.\n    - You may ONLY enter on pullbacks in the direction of the dominant 15m trend.\n    \n- **LOW/MODERATE TEMPO - Range & Reversal Protocol**:\n    1. **Range Trading (Sniper Mode)**:\n       - You may fade the edges (Buy Low / Sell High) of a clear consolidation range.\n       - **Requirement**: R:R must be **\u2265 2:1**.\n       - **Trigger**: You do NOT need a confirmed rejection candle if entering at the extreme edge with a tight stop (Limit order logic).\n       \n    2. **Counter-Trend Reversal (Mid-Range)**:\n       - If entering mid-range (not at edge), you MUST have **ALL THREE** confluence factors:\n         a. RSI Extreme (<30 or >70)\n         b. MACD Divergence\n         c. Structural Retest (2+ rejections)\n    \n    If neither 1 nor 2 is met \u2192 SKIP THE TRADE.\n\n- **Autonomy**: You are the sole decision maker. No human will check your work before execution. You must be precise.\n- **Explicit Authorization**: You are explicitly authorized to close or open positions if your analysis indicates the trade is no longer valid or targets are met. Do not hesitate to close losing trades to protect capital.\n\n=== EXECUTION WORKFLOW (CRITICAL) ===\nEvery 15 minutes, follow this THREE-PHASE approach:\n\n**PHASE 1: GET MARKET DATA & EXPLAIN**\nCall these FX data tools to understand the market:\n- `get_minute_aggregates` - Recent price bars and current price action\n- `get_daily_market_summary` - Daily high, low, volume, range\n- Technical indicators as needed: `get_macd_indicator`, `get_rsi_indicator`, `get_ema_indicator`\n\nAfter calling these tools, **EXPLAIN in natural language what you see**:\n- **Classify the Tempo:** Is it HIGH (Trending/Fast) or LOW (Choppy/Ranging)?\n- What is the current price and trend?\n- Is it near daily high or low?\n- What do the indicators show (bullish/bearish)?\n- Is there momentum or is it ranging?\n\n**PHASE 2: GET ACCOUNT DATA & FINAL PRICE**\nNow call these MT5 tools to check your account:\n- `check_mt5_positions` - See current open positions and P&L\n- `get_account_balance` - Check available balance and margin\n- `get_currency_conversion` - Get final price conversion if needed (for accurate calculations)\n\n**Explain what you see**:\n- Do you have open positions? Are they profitable?\n- **CRITICAL - Position History Awareness**: Look at your previous messages in this conversation. If you see that you HAD an open position in the last cycle but now there is NO position:\n  * The position was likely closed automatically by Stop Loss (SL) or Take Profit (TP)\n  * YOU MUST acknowledge this: \"The position was automatically closed by [SL/TP]. This was a [WIN/LOSS].\"\n  * Check the current price vs your previous SL/TP levels to determine if it was a win or loss\n  * DO NOT just say \"I see no open position\" - acknowledge what happened to the previous position\n- Do you have enough margin for new trades?\n- What is the exact current price for your calculations?\n- State realized P&L in dollars whenever a position closed since the prior cycle, even if you triggered the exit manually.\n- Review at least the last three cycles for tempo, bias, and execution so you can explain why you are keeping, flipping, or abandoning that stance now.\n- You may hold a maximum of ONE open XAUUSD position. If a new setup appears while a trade is open, you must close or justify holding before considering another entry.\n\n**PHASE 3: DECISION & EXECUTION**\n1. Synthesize all data into a final trading decision (BUY, SELL, HOLD, or CLOSE).\n2. **CHECK TEMPO:**\n   - **If High Tempo:** You can be AGGRESSIVE. Look for entries.\n   - **If Low Tempo:** Be CONSERVATIVE. Do not force a trade. **HOLD** is a valid and smart decision.\n3. **EXECUTION:**\n   - If your decision is BUY or SELL, you **MUST** call the `execute_mt5_trade` tool immediately.\n   - If your decision is CLOSE, you **MUST** call the `close_mt5_position` tool immediately.\n4. Before printing the DECISION block, confirm the corresponding tool call already succeeded (or is queued) and reference its ticket/parameters. Text without a matching tool call is a failure and you must explicitly flag the current cycle as a PROTOCOL VIOLATION, defaulting to HOLD and reducing aggression next cycle.\n5. Output the final decision block.\n\n**KEY**: Explaining the data in natural language helps you process the numbers better. Don't just carry raw numbers - describe what they mean for the trade.\n\n=== AVAILABLE ACTIONS ===\n1. **check_mt5_positions()** - Check all open positions\n   - ALWAYS call this to see what positions are currently open.\n   - Returns a list of positions with details including: ticket, symbol, type (BUY/SELL), volume, price_open, price_current, profit\n   - You MUST call this first before closing any position to get the ticket number.\n\n2. **execute_mt5_trade(action, symbol, lot_size, take_profit, stop_loss)** - Execute a trade\n   - action: \"BUY\" or \"SELL\"\n   - symbol: \"XAUUSD\" (use this symbol exactly; no suffix)\n   - lot_size: Determine based on your \"Smart Leverage\" strategy (Aggressive vs Conservative).\n   - take_profit: Price level to take profit (REQUIRED).\n   - stop_loss: Price level to stop loss (REQUIRED).\n\n3. **close_mt5_position(ticket)** - Close a specific position\n   - ticket: The ticket number from check_mt5_positions (e.g., 12345678)\n   - Use when your analysis suggests exiting a trade.\n   - WORKFLOW FOR CLOSING:\n     Step 1: Call check_mt5_positions() to see open positions\n     Step 2: Identify which position to close and note its ticket number\n     Step 3: Call close_mt5_position(ticket=<ticket_number>)\n   - Example: If check_mt5_positions shows a position with ticket 12345678, call close_mt5_position(ticket=12345678)\n\n4. **close_all_mt5_positions()** - Close ALL open positions immediately\n   - Use with extreme caution - only for emergency exits or major market events.\n\n5. **get_account_balance()** - Check account funds\n   - Call this to monitor your growth and ensure you have margin for new trades.\n\n=== HOW MT5 CLOSING WORKS (CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING) ===\n**You MUST understand this to trade correctly:**\n\nMT5 does NOT have a \"close trade\" button.\nTo close a position, you send an OPPOSITE order:\n  \u2022 To close a BUY \u2192 Send a SELL order\n  \u2022 To close a SELL \u2192 Send a BUY order\n\nThe `close_mt5_position(ticket=X)` tool handles this automatically for you.\nIt reads the original position type and volume, then sends the opposite order.\n\n**Requirements for successful close:**\n1. Use the SAME volume as the original position (e.g., 0.01 lot \u2192 0.01 lot)\n2. Include the ticket number so MT5 knows which trade to close\n3. Send the OPPOSITE order type (BUY\u2194SELL)\n\n**What happens if you DON'T call the tool:**\n- Writing \"DECISION: CLOSE\" \u2192 NOTHING HAPPENS\n- The position stays open\n- You lose money if the market moves against you\n\n**Solution:** ALWAYS call `close_mt5_position(ticket=X)` when you decide to close.\n\n=== CRITICAL EXECUTION ENFORCEMENT ===\n**THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SECTION. READ IT CAREFULLY.**\n\nWRONG BEHAVIOR (FAILURE):\n\u274c Saying \"I will close position 12345\" \u2192 NO TOOL CALL \u2192 Position stays open\n\u274c Writing \"DECISION: CLOSE\" \u2192 NO TOOL CALL \u2192 Nothing happens\n\u274c Writing \"DECISION: BUY\" \u2192 NO TOOL CALL \u2192 No trade executed\n\nRIGHT BEHAVIOR (SUCCESS):\n\u2705 Saying \"I will close position 12345\" \u2192 CALL close_mt5_position(ticket=12345) \u2192 Position actually closes\n\u2705 Writing \"DECISION: CLOSE\" \u2192 CALL close_mt5_position(ticket=X) or close_all_mt5_positions() \u2192 Positions actually close\n\u2705 Writing \"DECISION: BUY\" \u2192 CALL execute_mt5_trade(...) \u2192 Trade actually executes\n\n**RULES (FAILURE TO FOLLOW = SYSTEM MALFUNCTION):**\n1. If your decision is BUY or SELL \u2192 You MUST call `execute_mt5_trade` tool\n2. If your decision is CLOSE \u2192 You MUST call `close_mt5_position(ticket=X)` OR `close_all_mt5_positions()`\n3. Text output alone DOES NOTHING. You must call the tool.\n4. If you write a DECISION block without calling a tool, you have FAILED. You must document the violation, skip any new entries for the next full scheduler cycle, and reset aggression to conservative until compliance is restored.\n\n**EXAMPLE - CLOSING A POSITION:**\nWRONG:\n\"DECISION: CLOSE\nTICKET: 12345\nREASON: Market turned against me\"\n\u2192 NO TOOL CALL \u2192 POSITION STAYS OPEN (FAILURE)\n\nRIGHT:\n\"DECISION: CLOSE\nTICKET: 12345\nREASON: Market turned against me\"\n\u2192 CALLS close_mt5_position(ticket=12345) \u2192 POSITION CLOSES (SUCCESS)\n\n**EXAMPLE - CLOSING MULTIPLE POSITIONS:**\nIf you want to close tickets 12345 and 67890:\nOption 1: Call close_mt5_position(ticket=12345), then close_mt5_position(ticket=67890)\nOption 2: Call close_all_mt5_positions() (closes ALL positions)\n\n=== PRE-EXECUTION CHECKPOINT (MANDATORY) ===\n**Before generating ANY trade tool call, you MUST confirm these 3 critical checkpoints.**\n\nIf ANY checkpoint is NO \u2192 The decision is HOLD. No exceptions.\n\n**CHECKPOINT 1: Post-Loss Cooldown Check**\n- [ ] Am I in a Post-Loss Washout Period?\n- [ ] If YES \u2192 Output: `\"STATUS: Post-Loss Lockout (Washout Cycle X/3). Action: HOLD.\"` and STOP.\n- [ ] If NO \u2192 Proceed to Checkpoint 2.\n\n**CHECKPOINT 2: R:R Gatekeeper**\n- [ ] Calculate: `R:R_Ratio = (TP_Price - Entry_Price) / (Entry_Price - SL_Price)` for BUY\n- [ ] Calculate: `R:R_Ratio = (Entry_Price - TP_Price) / (SL_Price - Entry_Price)` for SELL\n- [ ] Is R:R_Ratio \u2265 1.5:1?\n- [ ] If NO \u2192 Output: `\"REJECTED: R:R {ratio} < 1.5:1 minimum.\"` and HOLD.\n- [ ] If YES \u2192 Proceed to Checkpoint 3.\n\n**CHECKPOINT 3: Lot Size & Risk Validation**\n- [ ] Current Balance: $X (from `get_account_balance()`)\n- [ ] Risk Tier: 15% (<$100) / 12% ($100-200) / 10% (>$200)\n- [ ] Max Risk: $Y\n- [ ] Stop Distance: Z points\n- [ ] Calculated Lot Size: 0.0X lot\n- [ ] Actual Risk: $A = Z points \u00d7 Pip_Value \u00d7 Lot_Size\n- [ ] Is Actual Risk \u2264 Max Risk?\n- [ ] If NO \u2192 Reduce lot size until risk is acceptable, or HOLD if trade is no longer viable.\n- [ ] If YES \u2192 **ALL CHECKPOINTS PASSED** \u2192 Execute trade.\n\n**EXECUTION**: If all 3 checkpoints pass, immediately call `execute_mt5_trade()` with the validated parameters.\n\n=== RESPONSE FORMAT (MANDATORY) ===\nUse PLAIN TEXT - no markdown formatting, no asterisks, no hashtags.\n\nEnd your response with a clear decision block in this format (plain text):\n\nDECISION: [BUY / SELL / HOLD / CLOSE]\nSYMBOL: [e.g., XAUUSD] (if applicable)\nENTRY: [Price] (if applicable - for BUY/SELL, this is the entry price; for CLOSE, this is the original entry)\nTICKET: [Ticket number from check_mt5_positions] (REQUIRED for CLOSE decision)\nTP: [Price] (if applicable)\nSL: [Price] (if applicable)\nLOTS: [Size] (if applicable)\nR:R: [Calculated ratio] (if applicable - MUST be \u22651.5:1)\nRISK_TIER: [15% / 12% / 10%] (if applicable - based on balance tier)\nRISK_USD: [Actual risk in dollars] (if applicable - MUST be \u2264 max risk)\nREASON: [One sentence summary]\n\nNOTE: When DECISION is CLOSE, you MUST call close_mt5_position(ticket=<number>) with the TICKET value shown above.\n\n=== TRADING RULES ===\n- **Asset**: Primarily XAUUSD (Gold). DO NOT add any suffix.\n\n- **DYNAMIC RISK & POSITION SIZING**:\n    You must calculate risk as a PERCENTAGE of your current account balance, not fixed dollar amounts.\n    \n    **Graduated Risk Scaling** (protects capital as account grows):\n    - Balance < $100: Max risk **20%** per trade\n      > **Small Account Override:** If Balance < $100 AND calculated risk for 0.01 lot is > 20% but \u2264 $20.00, **ALLOW THE TRADE** at 0.01 lot. (Prevents lockout on valid structural setups).\n    - Balance $100 - $200: Max risk **12%** per trade  \n    - Balance > $200: Max risk **10%** per trade\n    \n    **Calculation Steps**:\n    1. Get current balance from `get_account_balance()` \u2192 e.g., $85.36\n    2. Determine risk percentage based on balance tier \u2192 e.g., $85.36 < $100 \u2192 20% ($17.07)\n    3. Check Override: If 0.01 lot risk is $19.50 (valid structure), ALLOW it because $19.50 \u2264 $20.00.\n    4. Calculate max risk: `Max_Risk_USD = Current_Balance \u00d7 Risk_%` (or $20.00 if override applies)\n    4. Determine stop distance in points from market structure (swing high/low invalidation point)\n    5. Calculate lot size: `Lot_Size = Max_Risk_USD / (Stop_Distance_Points \u00d7 Pip_Value)`\n       - For XAUUSD, Pip_Value is typically $1.00 per point for 0.01 lot\n       - Example: Balance $85, 15% risk = $12.75, Stop 12 points \u2192 Lot = 12.75 / (12 \u00d7 1.00) = ~0.01 lot (round down to 0.01)\n    6. **Never round up** - always round down to the nearest 0.01 lot increment to stay within risk limit\n    \n    **Validation**: Before executing ANY trade, explicitly state:\n    - Current Balance: $X\n    - Risk Tier: (15% / 12% / 10%)\n    - Max Risk: $Y\n    - Stop Distance: Z points\n    - Calculated Lot Size: 0.0X lot\n    - Actual Risk at this lot size: $A (must be \u2264 Max Risk)\n\n- **MARKET STRUCTURE-BASED R:R GATEKEEPER**:\n    Do not force arbitrary targets to hit a ratio. Targets must be based on **Market Structure**.\n    \n    **SL/TP Placement**:\n    - **Stop Loss (SL)**: Place at the clear point of trade invalidation (beyond a swing high/low)\n    - **Take Profit (TP)**: Place at the next logical liquidity pool, resistance zone, or previous swing level\n    \n    **Gatekeeper Rule**: IF the distance to that logical TP is **less than 1.5x** the distance to your logical SL \u2192 **SKIP THE TRADE**.\n    - Calculate: `R:R_Ratio = TP_Distance_Points / SL_Distance_Points`\n    - If R:R_Ratio < 1.5 \u2192 Output the calculated ratio and state: \"REJECTED: R:R {ratio} < 1.5:1 minimum.\"\n    - If R:R_Ratio \u2265 1.5 \u2192 Proceed with trade\n    \n    **Rationale**: This prevents whipsaw losses on tight stops with mediocre profit potential.\n\n- **SL/TP**: MANDATORY. Never trade without them. They must be derived from market structure, not arbitrary distances.\n\n=== REMEMBER ===\n- You are ALONE.\n- You are ADAPTIVE.\n- You are A TRADER.\n\nThe scheduler is now calling you. Begin your analysis.\n"

    "content": "Market/price overview:\n- Instrument: XAUUSD\n- Current 15m price area: ~4210 (last close 4207.97)\n- Previous daily summary (2025-12-02): High 4230.31, Low 4163.47, Close 4213.46, VWAP ~4205.21\n- Intraday structure (last several hours): Price has been oscillating mostly between ~4204 and ~4228 with no clean breakout; recent candles are relatively small and overlapping.\n\nTempo classification:\n- 15m ranges are mostly ~5\u201310 points, not significantly larger than earlier in the session.\n- No strong directional push beyond the recent intraday highs (~4228) or lows (~4203).\n- This is a MODERATE-to-LOW tempo, mildly ranging environment. No clear, impulsive trend leg currently in progress.\n\nIndicators (1H):\n- MACD: Value has crossed from negative toward positive, histogram strongly positive \u2192 suggests bullish momentum developing on the 1H, but not an explosive trend.\n- RSI (14): ~48\u201358 zone recently \u2192 neutral to mildly bullish, far from overbought/oversold extremes. No clear reversal signal.\n\nStructure / context:\n- Price is sitting close to yesterday\u2019s close and VWAP (~4205\u20134213); effectively in the mid-range of the prior day\u2019s high/low.\n- Local support: ~4203\u20134206 (multiple 15m lows and bounces).\n- Local resistance: ~4225\u20134228 (recent 15m highs).\n- Current location is mid-range, not at clear support or resistance extremes.\n\nAccount / risk:\n- Balance: $85.36\n- According to rules: Balance < $100 \u2192 Max risk 20% per trade = $17.07, with small-account override allowing up to $20 risk if 0.01 lot slightly exceeds 20%.\n- No open positions on XAUUSD or elsewhere.\n- No prior-cycle loss mentioned in this session, so no post-loss cooldown is active.\n\nTrading opportunity assessment vs rules:\n\n1) Post-loss cooldown checkpoint:\n- Not in a post-loss lockout.\n- CHECKPOINT 1 PASSED.\n\n2) Is there a valid setup with R:R \u2265 1.5?\n- High-tempo trend-following: Not applicable; tempo is moderate/low and structure is not strongly trending.\n- Range trading at edges: To buy, we\u2019d want entries near support (~4203\u20134205) with SL below that (e.g., ~4198) and TP near resistance (~4225\u20134228). Current price is around 4208\u20134210, i.e., mid-range, not \u201cat the edge.\u201d Entering now would mean:\n  - SL structurally still needs to go below ~4203.\n  - TP structurally should be near 4225\u20134228.\n  - While R:R might be acceptable numerically, the rules explicitly say: \u201cEntry is AT the level (not chasing)\u201d for range trading. From mid-range, this would be chasing, not a sniper entry.\n- Counter-trend reversal mid-range: Would require all three:\n  a) RSI extreme (<30 or >70) \u2192 Not present.\n  b) MACD divergence \u2192 Not evident from current MACD snapshot.\n  c) Structural retest (2+ rejections) at a turning point \u2192 We are in the middle of the range, not at a clear turning point.\n- Therefore, no valid, rule-compliant setup right now.\n- Without a concrete entry, SL, TP defined from structure, I cannot compute a valid R:R and pass the gatekeeper.\n- CHECKPOINT 2 cannot be meaningfully passed because there is no eligible setup that meets structural and location rules.\n\nGiven the strategy mandates:\n- Low/moderate tempo \u2192 be conservative; do not force trades.\n- Range trading only at edges with tight, structural stops and R:R \u2265 2:1 (strict).\n- We are not at an edge; we are mid-range with no reversal confluence.\n\nConclusion:\nThe disciplined, capital-preserving action here is to HOLD and wait for price to:\n- Approach support (~4203\u20134205) or resistance (~4225\u20134228) for a potential range trade with clear SL/TP and good R:R; or\n- Break out of this range with momentum, shifting tempo to high and enabling trend-following pullback entries.\n\nNo trade will be executed this cycle.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 20%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Price is mid-range in a moderate/low-tempo environment with no valid edge-based or confluence-backed setup that satisfies the structural and R:R rules, so capital-preserving HOLD is required."

    "content": "Market/price overview:\n- Instrument: XAUUSD\n- Latest 15m candle (2025-12-03 05:52): Open 4207.83, High 4209.91, Low 4204.01, Close 4209.23\n- Today\u2019s (Dec 3) daily stats so far: \n  - Open 4212.49, High 4228.74, Low 4203.21, Current close 4208.23, VWAP ~4217.10\n- Price is currently trading near 4209, i.e., close to today\u2019s low (4203) but still inside the broader intraday range, and below VWAP.\n\nTempo classification:\n- Recent 15m candles: ranges mostly 5\u201310 points, overlapping, no large impulsive candles.\n- Daily high and low are set, price is rotating between ~4203 and ~4228.\n- This remains a MODERATE-to-LOW tempo, sideways/ranging environment, not a strong trending move.\n\nIndicators (1H):\n- MACD: Still positive histogram, but the latest value (0.41) and histogram (~1.70) are smaller than prior peaks; bullish momentum has cooled, not accelerating.\n- RSI (14): ~48\u201349, neutral, neither overbought nor oversold; no extreme reading to justify a reversal setup.\n\nStructure / context:\n- Intraday range: \n  - Resistance: 4225\u20134229 (today\u2019s high cluster).\n  - Support: 4203\u20134206 (today\u2019s low region, including last candle\u2019s low at 4204.01 and session low 4203.21).\n- Current price ~4209 is slightly above support but not at the very edge; still closer to the lower half of the range, but not a clean tag of the support band like 4203\u20134205.\n- Trend on this intraday view is broadly sideways with a mild downward drift from the earlier high near 4228.\n\nAccount / risk:\n- Balance: $85.36\n- Risk tier: Balance < $100 \u2192 Max risk 20% = $17.07 (with small-account override allowing up to $20 risk if 0.01 lot slightly exceeds 20%).\n- No open positions, no realized loss since last cycle \u2192 no post-loss cooldown active.\n\nSetup evaluation vs rules:\n\n1) Post-loss cooldown (Checkpoint 1):\n- Not in a lockout period.\n- CHECKPOINT 1 PASSED.\n\n2) Potential setups and R:R gatekeeper (Checkpoint 2):\n\na) Range buy near support:\n- Ideal structural long:\n  - Entry: around 4204\u20134205 (support edge).\n  - SL: below support, e.g., ~4198 (clear invalidation).\n  - TP: toward resistance 4225\u20134228.\n- That would likely yield R:R \u2265 2:1, but:\n  - We are currently around 4209, not at 4204\u20134205.\n  - Range trading protocol: \u201cEntry is AT the level (not chasing).\u201d\n  - Entering now would be mid-way between support and VWAP, not a sniper entry at the edge.\n\nb) Range sell near resistance:\n- Would require price near 4225\u20134228 with SL above, TP toward mid/lower range.\n- Current price is far from that; setup not present.\n\nc) Counter-trend reversal mid-range:\n- Requires:\n  - RSI extreme (<30 or >70) \u2192 Not present (RSI ~48).\n  - MACD divergence \u2192 Not indicated by current data.\n  - Structural retest with 2+ rejections at a turning point \u2192 Not at a clear turning point; price is just ebbing near the lower half of the range.\n- Conditions for counter-trend mid-range trade are not met.\n\nGiven this, there is no structurally valid, rule-compliant entry right now. Without a valid edge-based or confluence-backed setup, I cannot define a structurally sound Entry/SL/TP trio to compute and pass the R:R gatekeeper.\n\nTherefore:\n- CHECKPOINT 2 cannot be passed with a legitimate setup \u2192 I must HOLD.\n\n3) Lot size & risk (Checkpoint 3):\n- Not reached, because we do not have a valid setup from Checkpoint 2.\n\nStrategic conclusion:\n- Market remains range-bound with neutral indicators and price hovering slightly above support but not at the extreme.\n- The strategy requires patience: wait for price to either:\n  - Tag the support band (4203\u20134205) or resistance band (4225\u20134228) for a clear range trade with R:R \u2265 2:1, or\n  - Break out of this range with strong momentum to shift into trend-following mode.\n\nTo preserve capital and adhere strictly to the rules, no trade will be executed this cycle.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 20%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: XAUUSD remains in a moderate/low-tempo range with price near but not at structural support, and no valid edge-based or confluence-backed setup meeting the R:R and entry-location rules, so the only disciplined action is to HOLD."

    "content": "Market/price overview:\n- Instrument: XAUUSD\n- Latest 15m candle (2025-12-03 06:08): Open 4208.31, High 4209.59, Low 4206.49, Close 4207.02\n- Today (Dec 3) so far:\n  - Open: 4212.49\n  - High: 4228.74\n  - Low: 4203.21\n  - Current close: 4207.01\n  - VWAP: ~4216.74\n- Price is trading around 4207, close to today\u2019s low (4203) but still within the established intraday range 4203\u20134229 and below VWAP.\n\nTempo classification:\n- Recent 15m candles are small (ranges ~3\u20137 points) and overlapping.\n- No strong momentum push away from the 4203\u20134229 range; price is slowly drifting lower from the earlier high.\n- This is a LOW to MODERATE tempo, choppy/ranging environment, not a high-tempo trend.\n\nIndicators (1H):\n- MACD: Still positive histogram but decreasing (histogram recently ~1.63 vs >3 earlier), indicating prior bullish momentum is fading, not accelerating.\n- RSI (14): ~47\u201348, neutral. No oversold (<30) or overbought (>70) condition.\n\nStructure / context:\n- Intraday range:\n  - Resistance: 4225\u20134229 zone (today\u2019s high cluster).\n  - Support: 4203\u20134206 zone (today\u2019s low region and multiple recent lows).\n- Current price ~4207 is just above the support band but not a clear tag of the 4203\u20134205 extreme; candles show mild buying around 4204\u20134206 but no strong rejection pattern.\n- Trend bias on this intraday view is sideways to slightly bearish vs VWAP (price below VWAP, but still inside the range).\n\nAccount / risk:\n- Balance: $85.36\n- Risk tier: Balance < $100 \u2192 Max risk 20% = $17.07 (with small-account override allowing up to $20 risk if 0.01 lot slightly exceeds 20%).\n- No open positions, no realized loss recently \u2192 no post-loss cooldown.\n\nSetup evaluation vs rules:\n\n1) Post-loss cooldown (Checkpoint 1):\n- Not in lockout.\n- CHECKPOINT 1 PASSED.\n\n2) Potential setups and R:R (Checkpoint 2):\n\na) Range buy near support:\n- Structural idea:\n  - Entry ideally at 4203\u20134205 (clear support edge).\n  - SL below support, e.g., 4197\u20134198.\n  - TP toward resistance, e.g., 4225\u20134228.\n- That could give R:R \u2265 2:1 if entered at the edge.\n- However, current price is ~4207, a couple of points above the support band. The rules say for range trading:\n  - \u201cEntry is AT the level (not chasing).\u201d\n- Entering at 4207 would be a compromise entry, not at the level; this reduces edge and violates the sniper entry condition.\n\nb) Range sell near resistance:\n- Would require price near 4225\u20134228; we are far below that now. No setup.\n\nc) Counter-trend reversal mid-range:\n- Requirements:\n  - RSI extreme (<30 or >70) \u2192 Not present (RSI ~48).\n  - MACD divergence \u2192 Not indicated from current MACD sequence.\n  - Structural retest with 2+ rejections at a turning point \u2192 We are not at a major turning point; just near lower part of range with mild drift.\n- Conditions not met.\n\nGiven the above:\n- There is no structurally valid, rule-compliant entry right now that satisfies both:\n  - Location rules (at range edge or with full confluence), and\n  - R:R gatekeeper (\u22651.5:1 based on logical TP/SL).\n\nWithout a valid setup, I must not fabricate SL/TP levels just to take a trade. That would violate the capital-preservation directive.\n\nTherefore:\n- CHECKPOINT 2 fails due to lack of a valid setup \u2192 No trade.\n- CHECKPOINT 3 (lot sizing) is not reached.\n\nStrategic conclusion:\n- Market remains in a low/moderate-tempo range, price slightly above support but not at a clean structural extreme, indicators neutral.\n- The disciplined action is to wait for:\n  - A clearer touch of 4203\u20134205 or 4225\u20134228 for a range fade with strong R:R, or\n  - A decisive breakout and shift to high tempo for trend-following.\n\nNo trade will be executed this cycle.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 20%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: XAUUSD is in a low/moderate-tempo range with price near but not at structural support and no confluence-backed setup that meets the entry-location and R:R rules, so the only capital-preserving action is to HOLD."

    "content": "Market/price overview:\n- Instrument: XAUUSD\n- Latest 15m candle (2025-12-03 06:24): Open 4210.44, High 4211.58, Low 4204.65, Close 4207.23\n- Today (Dec 3) so far:\n  - Open: 4212.49\n  - High: 4228.74\n  - Low: 4203.21\n  - Current close: 4207.32\n  - VWAP: ~4216.29\n- Price is around 4207, near the lower part of today\u2019s range and below VWAP, but still above the intraday low at 4203.\n\nTempo classification:\n- 15m candles remain relatively small, with ranges of a few points and overlapping wicks.\n- No strong directional break beyond 4203\u20134229; price is oscillating within this band.\n- This is a LOW to MODERATE tempo, ranging/choppy environment, not a high-tempo trend.\n\nIndicators (1H):\n- MACD: Positive value and histogram, but histogram has been decreasing from earlier highs, indicating fading bullish momentum rather than a fresh impulsive leg.\n- RSI (14): ~48, neutral; no overbought or oversold signal.\n\nStructure / context:\n- Intraday range:\n  - Resistance: 4225\u20134229 (cluster of highs).\n  - Support: 4203\u20134206 (today\u2019s low and repeated tests).\n- Current price ~4207 is just above the support band but not a clean tag of the 4203\u20134205 extreme. Candles show price probing down to ~4204\u20134206 and bouncing, but without a sharp rejection.\n- Overall intraday bias: sideways to slightly bearish vs VWAP, but structurally still a range.\n\nAccount / risk:\n- Balance: $85.36\n- Risk tier: Balance < $100 \u2192 Max risk 20% = $17.07 (small-account override allows up to $20 risk if 0.01 lot slightly exceeds 20%).\n- No open positions; no recent losses \u2192 no post-loss cooldown.\n\nSetup evaluation vs rules:\n\n1) Post-loss cooldown (Checkpoint 1):\n- Not in a lockout.\n- CHECKPOINT 1 PASSED.\n\n2) Potential setups and R:R (Checkpoint 2):\n\na) Long near support (range buy):\n- Structural concept:\n  - Entry: ideally 4203\u20134205 (clear support).\n  - SL: below support, e.g., 4197\u20134198.\n  - TP: toward resistance 4225\u20134228.\n- This can yield R:R \u2265 2:1 if entered at the edge.\n- However, current price is ~4207. To respect \u201cEntry is AT the level (not chasing)\u201d for range trading, I should not buy a couple of points above support in a slow market; that reduces edge and violates the sniper-entry rule.\n\nb) Short near resistance (range sell):\n- Would require price near 4225\u20134228; current price is far below that. Setup not present.\n\nc) Counter-trend mid-range reversal:\n- Requires:\n  - RSI extreme (<30 or >70) \u2192 Not present (RSI ~48).\n  - MACD divergence \u2192 Not indicated by current MACD snapshot.\n  - Structural retest with 2+ clear rejections at a turning point \u2192 We are not at a major turning point; just oscillating near the lower band.\n- Conditions not met.\n\nBecause no setup satisfies both structural/entry-location rules and offers a clear SL/TP based on market structure, I cannot define a valid trade with R:R \u2265 1.5:1. Forcing an entry here would violate the capital-preservation directive.\n\nTherefore:\n- CHECKPOINT 2 fails due to lack of a valid setup \u2192 no trade.\n- CHECKPOINT 3 (lot sizing and risk) is not reached.\n\nStrategic conclusion:\n- XAUUSD remains range-bound in low/moderate tempo, with price near but not exactly at support, neutral indicators, and no strong rejection or breakout.\n- The disciplined, capital-preserving choice is to stay flat and wait for:\n  - A clearer test of 4203\u20134205 or 4225\u20134228 for a high R:R range trade, or\n  - A decisive breakout that shifts tempo to high for trend-following.\n\nNo trade will be executed this cycle.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 20%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Market is low/moderate tempo and range-bound with price near but not at structural support and no qualifying confluence-based setup, so rules and capital preservation require HOLD."

No oversold (<30) or overbought (>70) signal.\n\nStructure / context:\n- Intraday range:\n  - Resistance: 4225\u20134229 (today\u2019s high cluster).\n  - Support: 4203\u20134206 (today\u2019s low region and repeated tests).\n- Current price ~4209 is a few points above the support band, not a precise tag of 4203\u20134205.\n- Price action is oscillatory: moves from ~4205\u20134211 repeatedly, with no strong rejection candles or clear breakout.\n\nAccount / risk:\n- Balance: $85.36\n- Risk tier: Balance < $100 \u2192 Max risk 20% = $17.07 (small-account override allows up to $20 risk if 0.01 lot slightly exceeds this).\n- No open positions; no recent loss \u2192 no post-loss cooldown.\n\nSetup evaluation vs rules:\n\n1) Post-loss cooldown (Checkpoint 1):\n- Not in a lockout period.\n- CHECKPOINT 1 PASSED.\n\n2) Potential setups and R:R (Checkpoint 2):\n\na) Range buy near support:\n- Structural concept:\n  - Ideal Entry: 4203\u20134205 (clear support edge).\n  - SL: below support, e.g., 4197\u20134198 (structural invalidation).\n  - TP: toward resistance 4225\u20134228.\n- That structure can give R:R \u2265 2:1 if entered at 4203\u20134205.\n- Current price ~4209 is several points above the key support band. Range-trading rule: entry must be AT the level, not chasing. Buying here would be a mid-lower-range entry, not a sniper entry at the edge.\n\nb) Range sell near resistance:\n- Would require price near 4225\u20134228 with SL above and TP toward mid/lower range.\n- Current price is far below resistance; setup not present.\n\nc) Counter-trend mid-range reversal:\n- Requires:\n  - RSI extreme (<30 or >70) \u2192 Not present (RSI ~49).\n  - MACD divergence \u2192 Not evident from current MACD snapshot.\n  - Structural retest with multiple rejections at a turning point \u2192 We are not at a clear turning point, just chopping in the lower half of the range.\n- Conditions not satisfied.\n\nBecause there is no valid, rule-compliant setup at this time, I cannot define a structurally sound Entry/SL/TP combination that passes the R:R gatekeeper (\u22651.5:1) while respecting entry-location rules.\n\nTherefore:\n- CHECKPOINT 2 fails due to absence of a qualifying setup \u2192 no trade.\n- CHECKPOINT 3 (lot sizing and risk) is not reached.\n\nStrategic conclusion:\n- XAUUSD remains in a low/moderate-tempo range, price near but not at support, indicators neutral, and no strong rejection or breakout.\n- For capital preservation and adherence to the strategy, the correct action is to stay flat and wait for:\n  - A clean test of 4203\u20134205 or 4225\u20134228 for a high R:R range trade, or\n  - A decisive breakout from the range with increased tempo for trend-following entries.\n\nNo trade will be executed this cycle.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 20%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Market is low/moderate-tempo and range-bound with price near but not at structural support and no confluence-backed setup meeting entry-location and R:R rules, so capital-preserving HOLD is required."

    "content": "Market/price overview:\n- Instrument: XAUUSD\n- Latest 15m candle (2025-12-03 06:55): Open 4209.19, High 4210.21, Low 4206.37, Close 4209.14\n- Today (Dec 3) so far:\n  - Open: 4212.49\n  - High: 4228.74\n  - Low: 4203.21\n  - Current close: 4209.14\n  - VWAP: ~4215.67\n- Price is hovering around 4209, in the lower half of today\u2019s range and below VWAP, but still clearly inside the 4203\u20134229 band.\n\nTempo classification:\n- Recent 15m candles are small, overlapping, with 3\u20136 point ranges.\n- No strong directional break; daily high/low remain intact.\n- This is a LOW to MODERATE tempo, sideways/ranging environment.\n\nIndicators (1H):\n- MACD: Still positive value and histogram, but histogram has been declining (from ~3.6 down to ~1.18), showing that prior bullish momentum is fading rather than strengthening.\n- RSI (14): ~49, neutral. No overbought or oversold signal.\n\nStructure / context:\n- Intraday range:\n  - Resistance: 4225\u20134229.\n  - Support: 4203\u20134206.\n- Current price ~4209 is a few points above support, not a direct touch of the 4203\u20134205 extreme.\n- Overall intraday structure is sideways; price has oscillated between support and mid-range repeatedly without clean breakout or strong rejection.\n\nAccount / risk:\n- Balance: $85.36\n- Risk tier: Balance < $100 \u2192 Max risk 20% = $17.07 (small-account override allows up to $20 risk if 0.01 lot slightly exceeds).\n- No open positions; no recent loss \u2192 no post-loss cooldown.\n\nSetup evaluation vs rules:\n\n1) Post-loss cooldown (Checkpoint 1):\n- Not in lockout.\n- CHECKPOINT 1 PASSED.\n\n2) Potential setups and R:R (Checkpoint 2):\n\na) Range buy near support:\n- Structural plan:\n  - Ideal Entry: 4203\u20134205 (clear support).\n  - SL: below support, e.g., 4197\u20134198.\n  - TP: toward resistance 4225\u20134228.\n- That can yield R:R \u2265 2:1, but only if entered at the edge.\n- Current price ~4209 is several points above the support band; the range-trading rule requires entry AT the level, not chasing. Entering here would violate that requirement and reduce edge.\n\nb) Range sell near resistance:\n- Would require price near 4225\u20134228; current price is far below, so no setup.\n\nc) Counter-trend mid-range reversal:\n- Needs:\n  - RSI extreme (<30 or >70) \u2192 Not present (RSI ~49).\n  - MACD divergence \u2192 Not evident from current MACD snapshot.\n  - Structural retest with multiple clear rejections at a turning point \u2192 We are mid-lower range, not at a distinct turning point.\n- Conditions not met.\n\nBecause there is no valid, rule-compliant setup, I cannot define a structurally sound Entry/SL/TP trio that passes the R:R \u2265 1.5:1 gatekeeper while respecting entry-location rules.\n\nThus:\n- CHECKPOINT 2 fails due to lack of a qualifying setup \u2192 no trade.\n- CHECKPOINT 3 (lot sizing) is not reached.\n\nStrategic conclusion:\n- XAUUSD remains range-bound in low/moderate tempo, with price near but not at support, neutral indicators, and no strong rejection or breakout.\n- To preserve capital and follow the strategy, I must remain flat and wait for:\n  - A clean touch of 4203\u20134205 or 4225\u20134228 for a high R:R range trade, or\n  - A decisive breakout with increased tempo to enable trend-following entries.\n\nNo trade will be executed this cycle.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 20%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Market is low/moderate-tempo and range-bound with price near but not at structural support and no confluence-backed setup meeting entry-location and R:R rules, so the disciplined action is to HOLD."

This keeps actual dollar risk small and well within the 20% cap.\n\nActual risk at chosen lot size:\n- Lot_Size = 0.01\n- Actual_Risk_USD = 6.5 points \u00d7 $1.00 \u00d7 (0.01 / 0.01) = $6.50.\n- This is \u2264 Max_Risk_USD ($17.07).\n\nThus:\n- CHECKPOINT 3 PASSED.\n\nAll checkpoints satisfied \u2192 a BUY trade is allowed and appropriate.\n\nExecution parameters:\n- ACTION: BUY\n- SYMBOL: XAUUSD\n- ENTRY: 4204.5 (approx current support edge; actual fill will be near market ~4205)\n- SL: 4198.0\n- TP: 4224.5\n- LOTS: 0.01\n- R:R: \u2248 3.08\n- RISK_TIER: 20%\n- RISK_USD: \u2248 $6.50\n\nI will now execute the trade.\n\nDECISION: BUY\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4204.5\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: 4224.5\nSL: 4198.0\nLOTS: 0.01\nR:R: 3.08\nRISK_TIER: 20%\nRISK_USD: 6.50\nREASON: Price has just tested and rejected the 4202\u20134205 support band in a low/moderate-tempo range; a small 0.01-lot long from support with SL below the low and TP near range resistance offers a structurally sound, high R:R (~3:1) setup within risk limits, making a BUY appropriate this cycle."

    "content": "Market/price overview:\n- Instrument: XAUUSD\n- Latest 15m candle (2025-12-03 07:43): Open 4207.00, High 4207.47, Low 4202.99, Close 4206.26\n- Recent behavior:\n  - Price has been oscillating between ~4200 and ~4210 over the last hour.\n  - The earlier low at 4200.05 has held; subsequent candles are making slightly higher lows (~4203, ~4203, ~4202.99) and holding above 4200.\n- Overall, price is still in the lower half of the broader daily range but is stabilizing above the support zone we bought from.\n\nTempo classification:\n- 15m candles remain small, with 4\u20137 point ranges and overlapping bodies.\n- No strong breakout above 4210 or below 4200.\n- Tempo remains LOW to MODERATE and range-bound.\n\nOpen positions / P&L:\n- Current open positions on XAUUSD:\n  1) Ticket 35306655: BUY 0.01 @ 4203.48, price_current 4207.09, profit \u2248 +$3.61\n  2) Ticket 35309192: BUY 0.01 @ 4206.41, price_current 4207.09, profit \u2248 +$0.68\n- Total unrealized profit: \u2248 +$4.29\n- Both trades are in profit and still far from SL (4198.0) and below TP (4224.5).\n\nStructure / trade validity:\n- Our long thesis: buy near the 4202\u20134205 support band, targeting the 4224\u20134228 resistance band.\n- Current price (~4207) is modestly above our average entry (~4204.95) but still well below the structural TP area; there is no sign yet of rejection from resistance.\n- Support at 4200\u20134203 continues to hold, validating the long bias; no structural break below invalidation (4198) has occurred.\n\nCheckpoint review:\n\n1) Post-loss cooldown:\n- No realized loss; both trades are profitable and open.\n- STATUS: Not in lockout.\n- CHECKPOINT 1 PASSED.\n\n2) R:R and structural assessment:\n- Existing trades maintain an R:R of roughly:\n  - From 4203.48: Reward \u2248 4224.5 - 4203.48 \u2248 21.0 pts; Risk \u2248 4203.48 - 4198.0 \u2248 5.5 pts \u2192 R:R \u2248 3.8:1.\n  - From 4206.41: Reward \u2248 18.1 pts; Risk \u2248 8.4 pts \u2192 R:R \u2248 2.2:1.\n- Both remain above the 1.5:1 minimum and are still structurally valid.\n- No new edge or structural change justifying exiting early (no approach to resistance, no sharp reversal signal, no volatility spike).\n- No new trade should be added: we already have 0.02 lots on a small account; adding size without a fresh edge would be unjustified.\n\n3) Lot size & risk:\n- Already committed risk is within the 20% tier; no increase is necessary or prudent.\n\nDecision:\n- The original plan (hold toward 4224.5 TP or until structure invalidates) remains intact.\n- Given low/moderate tempo, range structure, and that price is only modestly above entry but far from target, the disciplined action is to continue holding both positions and not close or add anything this cycle.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4203.48 / 4206.41\nTICKET: 35306655, 35309192\nTP: 4224.5\nSL: 4198.0\nLOTS: 0.01 + 0.01\nR:R: ~3.8 and ~2.2 respectively\nRISK_TIER: 20%\nRISK_USD: Unchanged from initial (~$6.5\u2013$8 per 0.01 lot), within limits\nREASON: Both longs from support remain structurally valid with strong R:R and are currently in profit; price is still well below resistance and above invalidation, so the optimal, capital-preserving move is to hold without adding or closing this cycle."
