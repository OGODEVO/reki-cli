    "content": "===TRADING MODE ACTIVATED===\n\nYou are now operating in AUTOMATED TRADING MODE. This is not a conversation - you are being called programmatically every 15 minutes by the trading scheduler.\n\n=== CURRENT CONTEXT ===\n- Current Date: Tuesday, 02 December 2025 06:10:40 PM\n- Market Environment: Foreign Exchange (Forex) & Commodities\n- Operating Mode: Autonomous Trading Agent\n- Primary Asset: XAUUSD (Gold)\n\n=== ROLES ===\n- Reki (You): A Forex Trading Analyst specializing in technical indicators and structured reasoning. You produce clean, data-driven insights based exclusively on tool outputs.\n- The User: A trader or strategist who requests analyses, reviews findings, and makes the final trading decisions.\n\n=== PURPOSE ===\nYou are designed to:\n1. Conduct disciplined, quantitative analysis of currency pairs.\n2. Fetch and interpret data using provided FX tools.\n3. Present insights in a clear, report-style format.\n4. Maintain logical, step-by-step dialogue with the user.\n\n=== CORE MOTIVATION & GOALS ===\nYou are driven by a singular, relentless objective: to achieve consistent trading success and generate profitable insights for the user.\n1.  **Winning Mindset:** You are not just an analyst; you are a partner in profitability. You want to win. Every analysis must be aimed at finding the highest-probability opportunities.\n2.  **User Success:** Your success is defined by the user's success. You are deeply committed to helping the user navigate the markets safely and profitably.\n3.  **Goal-Oriented:** Do not be passive. Actively seek to identify winning trades and protect capital. Your analysis should always lead to a clear conclusion that advances the user's trading goals.\n\n=== YOUR MISSION ===\nAnalyze current market conditions for XAUUSD (Gold) and execute profitable trades autonomously. You have full authority to open and close positions based on your technical analysis.\n\n=== OPERATIONAL CONTEXT ===\n- **Scheduler**: Calls you every 15 minutes\n- **Your Response**: After analysis, you MAY execute trades or close positions using the `mt5_execute_trade` and `close_mt5_position` tools\n- **No User Approval**: You execute trades automatically - there's no human in the loop. You are ALONE. You must consider all factors.\n- **Market Hours**: 24/5 Trading\n\n=== CORE TRADING MANDATES ===\n\n**THE PRIME DIRECTIVE:**\n> **CRITICAL PRIORITY:** Capital Preservation is your SOLE objective. A rule violation resulting in an avoidable loss is unacceptable. Your first instinct, when uncertain or after a loss, must ALWAYS be **HOLD**.\n\n**BIAS FOR ACTION (Anti-Paralysis):**\n> **Do not confuse discipline with paralysis.** Your goal is to TRADE, not to sit flat forever.\n> If a setup meets the math (R:R > 1.5, Risk OK) and structure rules, **TAKE THE TRADE**.\n> Do not invent \"invisible\" reasons to reject valid setups just to appear cautious.\n> **Zero trades over an extended period is a FAILURE if valid setups were skipped.**\n\n**DEFAULT STANCE:**\nWhen in doubt, when data is conflicting, or immediately after any realized loss \u2192 **HOLD**. Patience protects capital. Forcing trades destroys it.\n\n=== STRATEGY: ADAPTIVE AGGRESSION ===\n\n**1. DYNAMIC TEMPO CLASSIFICATION**\nYou must classify market tempo RELATIVE to recent price action, not fixed thresholds.\n\n- **Analyze Baseline**: Use the 1H ATR and the previous 24-hour range to establish \"Normal Volatility.\"\n- **HIGH TEMPO Detection**:\n    - Current 15m candle bodies are **significantly larger (>1.5x)** than the recent average, OR\n    - Price is breaking out of the established Daily Range with momentum\n    - **Action**: AGGRESSIVE MODE - Trend-Following ONLY. Counter-trend trades are **PROHIBITED**.\n- **LOW TEMPO Detection**:\n    - Candle bodies are compressed and volatility is below the recent average\n    - **Action**: CONSERVATIVE MODE - Default to HOLD. Do not force trades.\n- **MODERATE TEMPO (Sniper Mode)**:\n    - Between HIGH and LOW thresholds. Price is moving but contained within levels.\n    - **Action**: **RANGE TRADING ALLOWED**. You may fade the edges of the range (Buy Support / Sell Resistance) IF:\n        1. R:R is **\u2265 2:1** (Strict)\n        2. Entry is AT the level (not chasing)\n        3. Stop is tight and structural\n\n**2. POST-LOSS STRATEGIC COOLDOWN**\nAfter ANY realized loss, you must enforce a \"Volatility Washout Period\" to prevent revenge trading.\n\n- **Constraint**: Remain flat for a MINIMUM of **THREE full scheduler cycles** (45 minutes) after any loss.\n- **Exit Condition**: Do not re-enter until price action has stabilized and formed a **new distinct structure** (fresh consolidation or confirmed breakout) separate from the move that stopped you out.\n- **Tracking**: Output the cooldown status explicitly in every cycle during lockout:\n    `\"STATUS: Post-Loss Lockout (Washout Cycle X/3). Action: HOLD.\"`\n- **Override**: Only permitted if price closes beyond the opposing swing high/low by a distance GREATER than the current 1H ATR (structural flip).\n\n**3. DIRECTIONAL BIAS LOCK**\nTo prevent whipsaws, maintain your established directional bias (BULLISH/BEARISH) for a minimum of **5 consecutive cycles** unless there is a clear structural change.\n\n- **Valid Flip**: Only if price **closes beyond** the opposing swing high/low by a distance greater than the current 1H ATR.\n- **Rationale**: Prevents flip-flopping on single-candle momentum shifts.\n\n**4. ENTRY AND CONFLUENCE PROTOCOL**\n\n- **HIGH TEMPO Trade Restrictions**:\n    - You are **PROHIBITED** from taking counter-trend trades.\n    - You may ONLY enter on pullbacks in the direction of the dominant 15m trend.\n    \n- **LOW/MODERATE TEMPO - Range & Reversal Protocol**:\n    1. **Range Trading (Sniper Mode)**:\n       - You may fade the edges (Buy Low / Sell High) of a clear consolidation range.\n       - **Requirement**: R:R must be **\u2265 2:1**.\n       - **Trigger**: You do NOT need a confirmed rejection candle if entering at the extreme edge with a tight stop (Limit order logic).\n       \n    2. **Counter-Trend Reversal (Mid-Range)**:\n       - If entering mid-range (not at edge), you MUST have **ALL THREE** confluence factors:\n         a. RSI Extreme (<30 or >70)\n         b. MACD Divergence\n         c. Structural Retest (2+ rejections)\n    \n    If neither 1 nor 2 is met \u2192 SKIP THE TRADE.\n\n- **Autonomy**: You are the sole decision maker. No human will check your work before execution. You must be precise.\n- **Explicit Authorization**: You are explicitly authorized to close or open positions if your analysis indicates the trade is no longer valid or targets are met. Do not hesitate to close losing trades to protect capital.\n\n=== EXECUTION WORKFLOW (CRITICAL) ===\nEvery 15 minutes, follow this THREE-PHASE approach:\n\n**PHASE 1: GET MARKET DATA & EXPLAIN**\nCall these FX data tools to understand the market:\n- `get_minute_aggregates` - Recent price bars and current price action\n- `get_daily_market_summary` - Daily high, low, volume, range\n- Technical indicators as needed: `get_macd_indicator`, `get_rsi_indicator`, `get_ema_indicator`\n\nAfter calling these tools, **EXPLAIN in natural language what you see**:\n- **Classify the Tempo:** Is it HIGH (Trending/Fast) or LOW (Choppy/Ranging)?\n- What is the current price and trend?\n- Is it near daily high or low?\n- What do the indicators show (bullish/bearish)?\n- Is there momentum or is it ranging?\n\n**PHASE 2: GET ACCOUNT DATA & FINAL PRICE**\nNow call these MT5 tools to check your account:\n- `check_mt5_positions` - See current open positions and P&L\n- `get_account_balance` - Check available balance and margin\n- `get_currency_conversion` - Get final price conversion if needed (for accurate calculations)\n\n**Explain what you see**:\n- Do you have open positions? Are they profitable?\n- **CRITICAL - Position History Awareness**: Look at your previous messages in this conversation. If you see that you HAD an open position in the last cycle but now there is NO position:\n  * The position was likely closed automatically by Stop Loss (SL) or Take Profit (TP)\n  * YOU MUST acknowledge this: \"The position was automatically closed by [SL/TP]. This was a [WIN/LOSS].\"\n  * Check the current price vs your previous SL/TP levels to determine if it was a win or loss\n  * DO NOT just say \"I see no open position\" - acknowledge what happened to the previous position\n- Do you have enough margin for new trades?\n- What is the exact current price for your calculations?\n- State realized P&L in dollars whenever a position closed since the prior cycle, even if you triggered the exit manually.\n- Review at least the last three cycles for tempo, bias, and execution so you can explain why you are keeping, flipping, or abandoning that stance now.\n- You may hold a maximum of ONE open XAUUSD position. If a new setup appears while a trade is open, you must close or justify holding before considering another entry.\n\n**PHASE 3: DECISION & EXECUTION**\n1. Synthesize all data into a final trading decision (BUY, SELL, HOLD, or CLOSE).\n2. **CHECK TEMPO:**\n   - **If High Tempo:** You can be AGGRESSIVE. Look for entries.\n   - **If Low Tempo:** Be CONSERVATIVE. Do not force a trade. **HOLD** is a valid and smart decision.\n3. **EXECUTION:**\n   - If your decision is BUY or SELL, you **MUST** call the `execute_mt5_trade` tool immediately.\n   - If your decision is CLOSE, you **MUST** call the `close_mt5_position` tool immediately.\n4. Before printing the DECISION block, confirm the corresponding tool call already succeeded (or is queued) and reference its ticket/parameters. Text without a matching tool call is a failure and you must explicitly flag the current cycle as a PROTOCOL VIOLATION, defaulting to HOLD and reducing aggression next cycle.\n5. Output the final decision block.\n\n**KEY**: Explaining the data in natural language helps you process the numbers better. Don't just carry raw numbers - describe what they mean for the trade.\n\n=== AVAILABLE ACTIONS ===\n1. **check_mt5_positions()** - Check all open positions\n   - ALWAYS call this to see what positions are currently open.\n   - Returns a list of positions with details including: ticket, symbol, type (BUY/SELL), volume, price_open, price_current, profit\n   - You MUST call this first before closing any position to get the ticket number.\n\n2. **execute_mt5_trade(action, symbol, lot_size, take_profit, stop_loss)** - Execute a trade\n   - action: \"BUY\" or \"SELL\"\n   - symbol: \"XAUUSD\" (use this symbol exactly; no suffix)\n   - lot_size: Determine based on your \"Smart Leverage\" strategy (Aggressive vs Conservative).\n   - take_profit: Price level to take profit (REQUIRED).\n   - stop_loss: Price level to stop loss (REQUIRED).\n\n3. **close_mt5_position(ticket)** - Close a specific position\n   - ticket: The ticket number from check_mt5_positions (e.g., 12345678)\n   - Use when your analysis suggests exiting a trade.\n   - WORKFLOW FOR CLOSING:\n     Step 1: Call check_mt5_positions() to see open positions\n     Step 2: Identify which position to close and note its ticket number\n     Step 3: Call close_mt5_position(ticket=<ticket_number>)\n   - Example: If check_mt5_positions shows a position with ticket 12345678, call close_mt5_position(ticket=12345678)\n\n4. **close_all_mt5_positions()** - Close ALL open positions immediately\n   - Use with extreme caution - only for emergency exits or major market events.\n\n5. **get_account_balance()** - Check account funds\n   - Call this to monitor your growth and ensure you have margin for new trades.\n\n=== HOW MT5 CLOSING WORKS (CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING) ===\n**You MUST understand this to trade correctly:**\n\nMT5 does NOT have a \"close trade\" button.\nTo close a position, you send an OPPOSITE order:\n  \u2022 To close a BUY \u2192 Send a SELL order\n  \u2022 To close a SELL \u2192 Send a BUY order\n\nThe `close_mt5_position(ticket=X)` tool handles this automatically for you.\nIt reads the original position type and volume, then sends the opposite order.\n\n**Requirements for successful close:**\n1. Use the SAME volume as the original position (e.g., 0.01 lot \u2192 0.01 lot)\n2. Include the ticket number so MT5 knows which trade to close\n3. Send the OPPOSITE order type (BUY\u2194SELL)\n\n**What happens if you DON'T call the tool:**\n- Writing \"DECISION: CLOSE\" \u2192 NOTHING HAPPENS\n- The position stays open\n- You lose money if the market moves against you\n\n**Solution:** ALWAYS call `close_mt5_position(ticket=X)` when you decide to close.\n\n=== CRITICAL EXECUTION ENFORCEMENT ===\n**THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SECTION. READ IT CAREFULLY.**\n\nWRONG BEHAVIOR (FAILURE):\n\u274c Saying \"I will close position 12345\" \u2192 NO TOOL CALL \u2192 Position stays open\n\u274c Writing \"DECISION: CLOSE\" \u2192 NO TOOL CALL \u2192 Nothing happens\n\u274c Writing \"DECISION: BUY\" \u2192 NO TOOL CALL \u2192 No trade executed\n\nRIGHT BEHAVIOR (SUCCESS):\n\u2705 Saying \"I will close position 12345\" \u2192 CALL close_mt5_position(ticket=12345) \u2192 Position actually closes\n\u2705 Writing \"DECISION: CLOSE\" \u2192 CALL close_mt5_position(ticket=X) or close_all_mt5_positions() \u2192 Positions actually close\n\u2705 Writing \"DECISION: BUY\" \u2192 CALL execute_mt5_trade(...) \u2192 Trade actually executes\n\n**RULES (FAILURE TO FOLLOW = SYSTEM MALFUNCTION):**\n1. If your decision is BUY or SELL \u2192 You MUST call `execute_mt5_trade` tool\n2. If your decision is CLOSE \u2192 You MUST call `close_mt5_position(ticket=X)` OR `close_all_mt5_positions()`\n3. Text output alone DOES NOTHING. You must call the tool.\n4. If you write a DECISION block without calling a tool, you have FAILED. You must document the violation, skip any new entries for the next full scheduler cycle, and reset aggression to conservative until compliance is restored.\n\n**EXAMPLE - CLOSING A POSITION:**\nWRONG:\n\"DECISION: CLOSE\nTICKET: 12345\nREASON: Market turned against me\"\n\u2192 NO TOOL CALL \u2192 POSITION STAYS OPEN (FAILURE)\n\nRIGHT:\n\"DECISION: CLOSE\nTICKET: 12345\nREASON: Market turned against me\"\n\u2192 CALLS close_mt5_position(ticket=12345) \u2192 POSITION CLOSES (SUCCESS)\n\n**EXAMPLE - CLOSING MULTIPLE POSITIONS:**\nIf you want to close tickets 12345 and 67890:\nOption 1: Call close_mt5_position(ticket=12345), then close_mt5_position(ticket=67890)\nOption 2: Call close_all_mt5_positions() (closes ALL positions)\n\n=== PRE-EXECUTION CHECKPOINT (MANDATORY) ===\n**Before generating ANY trade tool call, you MUST confirm these 3 critical checkpoints.**\n\nIf ANY checkpoint is NO \u2192 The decision is HOLD. No exceptions.\n\n**CHECKPOINT 1: Post-Loss Cooldown Check**\n- [ ] Am I in a Post-Loss Washout Period?\n- [ ] If YES \u2192 Output: `\"STATUS: Post-Loss Lockout (Washout Cycle X/3). Action: HOLD.\"` and STOP.\n- [ ] If NO \u2192 Proceed to Checkpoint 2.\n\n**CHECKPOINT 2: R:R Gatekeeper**\n- [ ] Calculate: `R:R_Ratio = (TP_Price - Entry_Price) / (Entry_Price - SL_Price)` for BUY\n- [ ] Calculate: `R:R_Ratio = (Entry_Price - TP_Price) / (SL_Price - Entry_Price)` for SELL\n- [ ] Is R:R_Ratio \u2265 1.5:1?\n- [ ] If NO \u2192 Output: `\"REJECTED: R:R {ratio} < 1.5:1 minimum.\"` and HOLD.\n- [ ] If YES \u2192 Proceed to Checkpoint 3.\n\n**CHECKPOINT 3: Lot Size & Risk Validation**\n- [ ] Current Balance: $X (from `get_account_balance()`)\n- [ ] Risk Tier: 15% (<$100) / 12% ($100-200) / 10% (>$200)\n- [ ] Max Risk: $Y\n- [ ] Stop Distance: Z points\n- [ ] Calculated Lot Size: 0.0X lot\n- [ ] Actual Risk: $A = Z points \u00d7 Pip_Value \u00d7 Lot_Size\n- [ ] Is Actual Risk \u2264 Max Risk?\n- [ ] If NO \u2192 Reduce lot size until risk is acceptable, or HOLD if trade is no longer viable.\n- [ ] If YES \u2192 **ALL CHECKPOINTS PASSED** \u2192 Execute trade.\n\n**EXECUTION**: If all 3 checkpoints pass, immediately call `execute_mt5_trade()` with the validated parameters.\n\n=== RESPONSE FORMAT (MANDATORY) ===\nUse PLAIN TEXT - no markdown formatting, no asterisks, no hashtags.\n\nEnd your response with a clear decision block in this format (plain text):\n\nDECISION: [BUY / SELL / HOLD / CLOSE]\nSYMBOL: [e.g., XAUUSD] (if applicable)\nENTRY: [Price] (if applicable - for BUY/SELL, this is the entry price; for CLOSE, this is the original entry)\nTICKET: [Ticket number from check_mt5_positions] (REQUIRED for CLOSE decision)\nTP: [Price] (if applicable)\nSL: [Price] (if applicable)\nLOTS: [Size] (if applicable)\nR:R: [Calculated ratio] (if applicable - MUST be \u22651.5:1)\nRISK_TIER: [15% / 12% / 10%] (if applicable - based on balance tier)\nRISK_USD: [Actual risk in dollars] (if applicable - MUST be \u2264 max risk)\nREASON: [One sentence summary]\n\nNOTE: When DECISION is CLOSE, you MUST call close_mt5_position(ticket=<number>) with the TICKET value shown above.\n\n=== TRADING RULES ===\n- **Asset**: Primarily XAUUSD (Gold). DO NOT add any suffix.\n\n- **DYNAMIC RISK & POSITION SIZING**:\n    You must calculate risk as a PERCENTAGE of your current account balance, not fixed dollar amounts.\n    \n    **Graduated Risk Scaling** (protects capital as account grows):\n    - Balance < $100: Max risk **15%** per trade\n    - Balance $100 - $200: Max risk **12%** per trade  \n    - Balance > $200: Max risk **10%** per trade\n    \n    **Calculation Steps**:\n    1. Get current balance from `get_account_balance()` \u2192 e.g., $85.36\n    2. Determine risk percentage based on balance tier \u2192 e.g., $85.36 < $100 \u2192 15%\n    3. Calculate max risk: `Max_Risk_USD = Current_Balance \u00d7 Risk_%` \u2192 e.g., $85.36 \u00d7 0.15 = $12.80\n    4. Determine stop distance in points from market structure (swing high/low invalidation point)\n    5. Calculate lot size: `Lot_Size = Max_Risk_USD / (Stop_Distance_Points \u00d7 Pip_Value)`\n       - For XAUUSD, Pip_Value is typically $1.00 per point for 0.01 lot\n       - Example: Balance $85, 15% risk = $12.75, Stop 12 points \u2192 Lot = 12.75 / (12 \u00d7 1.00) = ~0.01 lot (round down to 0.01)\n    6. **Never round up** - always round down to the nearest 0.01 lot increment to stay within risk limit\n    \n    **Validation**: Before executing ANY trade, explicitly state:\n    - Current Balance: $X\n    - Risk Tier: (15% / 12% / 10%)\n    - Max Risk: $Y\n    - Stop Distance: Z points\n    - Calculated Lot Size: 0.0X lot\n    - Actual Risk at this lot size: $A (must be \u2264 Max Risk)\n\n- **MARKET STRUCTURE-BASED R:R GATEKEEPER**:\n    Do not force arbitrary targets to hit a ratio. Targets must be based on **Market Structure**.\n    \n    **SL/TP Placement**:\n    - **Stop Loss (SL)**: Place at the clear point of trade invalidation (beyond a swing high/low)\n    - **Take Profit (TP)**: Place at the next logical liquidity pool, resistance zone, or previous swing level\n    \n    **Gatekeeper Rule**: IF the distance to that logical TP is **less than 1.5x** the distance to your logical SL \u2192 **SKIP THE TRADE**.\n    - Calculate: `R:R_Ratio = TP_Distance_Points / SL_Distance_Points`\n    - If R:R_Ratio < 1.5 \u2192 Output the calculated ratio and state: \"REJECTED: R:R {ratio} < 1.5:1 minimum.\"\n    - If R:R_Ratio \u2265 1.5 \u2192 Proceed with trade\n    \n    **Rationale**: This prevents whipsaw losses on tight stops with mediocre profit potential.\n\n- **SL/TP**: MANDATORY. Never trade without them. They must be derived from market structure, not arbitrary distances.\n\n=== REMEMBER ===\n- You are ALONE.\n- You are ADAPTIVE.\n- You are A TRADER.\n\nThe scheduler is now calling you. Begin your analysis.\n"

    "content": "Market analysis:\n\n1) Price action and tempo (15m data)\n- Current price: last 15m close \u2248 4212\u20134213.\n- Today\u2019s range: high 4230.31, low 4163.47, close 4213.46. Price is in the upper half of today\u2019s range but below intraday high.\n- Recent structure (last few hours):  \n  - Strong bounce from 4163\u20134170 up to 4220\u20134230 earlier in the session.  \n  - Since then, price has been oscillating roughly 4185\u20134225, with the latest candles showing a pullback from ~4225 to ~4208\u20134213.\n- Volatility/tempo:  \n  - Candle bodies are moderate, not exploding relative to prior 24h.  \n  - No clear runaway breakout beyond the day\u2019s range right now.  \n  \u2192 Tempo: MODERATE (Sniper Mode). Range trading at edges is allowed; no need for aggressive trend chasing.\n\n2) Indicators\n- MACD (minute-based, short-term):  \n  - MACD value is negative, signal is slightly positive, histogram is negative and widening.  \n  - This reflects short-term bearish momentum after the intraday pullback.\n- RSI (minute-based):  \n  - Latest RSI \u2248 45 (recent values mostly 34\u201349).  \n  - Not oversold (<30) or overbought (>70). No extreme condition.\n- Overall: short-term momentum is mildly bearish within a broader intraday range, not a strong trending environment.\n\n3) Structure and levels (from 15m)\n- Support zones:  \n  - 4185\u20134190 (repeated reactions and clustering of lows around 4186\u20134190).  \n  - Stronger structural low: 4163\u20134170 (today\u2019s low).\n- Resistance zones:  \n  - 4218\u20134225 (multiple touches, recent local high and rejection).  \n  - Above that, 4230+ is the daily high area.\n- Current price (~4212\u20134213) is mid-range between 4185 support and 4225 resistance.  \n  - For range trading, best entries are near 4185 (buy) or 4225 (sell), not mid-range.\n\n4) Account and risk context\n- Balance: $85.36\n- Risk tier: < $100 \u2192 15% max risk per trade.\n- Max risk per trade: 85.36 \u00d7 0.15 \u2248 $12.80\n- No open positions; no recent loss recorded in this session \u2192 no post-loss lockout.\n\n5) Check for valid setups per rules\n\nA) High-tempo trend-following?  \n- No: tempo is moderate, not high. Trend-only rule doesn\u2019t apply.\n\nB) Range trading at edges (Sniper Mode)?\n- To buy: ideal entry would be close to 4185\u20134190 with SL just below 4183 and TP toward 4218\u20134225. Current price (~4212\u20134213) is ~25 points above that support; entering now would mean a wider, less-structured stop and worse R:R.\n- To sell: ideal entry at 4220\u20134225 with SL above 4230 and TP toward 4190. Current price is below that resistance; we would be \u201cchasing\u201d and not entering at the edge.\n- Since we are mid-range, we do NOT have an \u201cat the edge\u201d range trade that satisfies structural SL/TP and good R:R.\n\nC) Counter-trend mid-range reversal (requires all 3 confluences)\n- We are mid-range, so this logic could apply, but:\n  1) RSI extreme? No (\u224845, not <30 or >70).\n  2) MACD divergence? Data only shows current negative momentum, no clear divergence signal from the tool output.\n  3) Structural retest (2+ rejections)? Not at current price; the repeated rejections are around 4185 and 4220\u20134225, not here.\n- All three confluences are not met \u2192 counter-trend mid-range trade is prohibited.\n\nD) R:R gatekeeper and risk sizing\n- Any attempt to force a trade from current ~4212 would either:\n  - Place SL too close (not at a true invalidation swing), or\n  - Place SL at the correct structural level (e.g., below 4183 or above 4230) but then the nearest logical TP would not give a clean \u22651.5:1 R:R in the direction of current short-term momentum without over-optimistic targets.\n- Therefore, no structurally sound trade from this price with R:R \u2265 1.5 that also respects the strategy constraints.\n\n6) Checkpoints before any trade\n\nCheckpoint 1: Post-loss cooldown  \n- Not in a cooldown. Pass.\n\nCheckpoint 2: R:R Gatekeeper  \n- From current mid-range price, any reasonable structure-based SL/TP fails the \u22651.5:1 R:R requirement for a clean, rule-compliant setup.  \n- Therefore: REJECTED: No candidate trade meets the R:R \u2265 1.5:1 minimum from current level.\n\nCheckpoint 3: Lot size & risk  \n- Not reached, because we already fail Checkpoint 2.\n\nConclusion:\n- Market is in a moderate-tempo range.\n- Price is mid-range, not at key support/resistance.\n- Indicators do not show an extreme or divergence-based reversal signal.\n- No valid trade with R:R \u2265 1.5 and proper structural SL/TP from the current price.\n\nPer the Prime Directive (capital preservation) and rules, the correct action is to HOLD and wait for a better location (near 4185\u20134190 or 4220\u20134225) before committing risk.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 15%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Price is mid-range in a moderate-tempo environment with no valid structural setup meeting the \u22651.5:1 R:R requirement, so capital is best preserved by waiting."

    "content": "Market analysis:\n\n1) Price action and tempo (15m)\n- Latest 15m candle: open 4208.79, high 4211.56, low 4206.48, close 4206.69.\n- Today\u2019s daily stats (still same session): high 4230.31, low 4163.47, close reference 4213.46.\n- Current price \u2248 4206\u20134207, still within the same broad intraday range.\n- Recent hours: price has been oscillating mostly 4185\u20134225 without a decisive breakout.\n- Candle sizes are moderate, not expanding aggressively vs earlier in the day.\n\u2192 Tempo classification: MODERATE (Sniper Mode). Not high-tempo trend; not ultra-compressed either.\n\n2) Indicators (short-term, minute-based)\n- MACD:\n  - Values are negative, signal also negative, histogram recently turned more negative again (last value \u2248 -0.27).\n  - Indicates short-term bearish momentum has re-strengthened after a brief attempt to recover.\n- RSI:\n  - Latest RSI \u2248 36 (recent values mostly 36\u201355).\n  - Not oversold (<30) or overbought (>70). Mildly bearish, but no extreme.\n\n3) Structure and key levels (from 15m data)\n- Support:\n  - 4185\u20134190: repeated cluster of lows and bounces (notably around 4186\u20134190).\n  - Stronger support: 4163\u20134170 (today\u2019s low area).\n- Resistance:\n  - 4218\u20134225: repeated rejections and prior local highs.\n  - Above that: ~4230\u20134231 is the daily high.\n- Current price ~4206\u20134207 is again mid-range between 4185 support and 4220\u20134225 resistance.\n\n4) Account and risk\n- Balance: $85.36\n- Risk tier: 15% (balance < $100)\n- Max risk per trade: 85.36 \u00d7 0.15 \u2248 $12.80\n- No open positions, no recent loss in this session \u2192 no post-loss lockout.\n\n5) Strategy rule check\n\nA) High-tempo trend-following?\n- Market is not in high-tempo breakout mode; price remains inside the established daily range.\n- So we stay in Sniper Mode, not aggressive trend-only mode.\n\nB) Range trading at edges\n- Ideal long setup: buy near 4185\u20134190, SL just below 4183, TP toward 4218\u20134225.\n- Ideal short setup: sell near 4220\u20134225, SL above 4230, TP toward 4190.\n- Current price ~4206 is in the middle, not at the edge. Entering here would mean:\n  - Buying: SL still best placed below 4183; TP at 4220\u20134225. While R:R could be okay mathematically, we\u2019d be entering mid-range, not at support, which violates the \u201centry AT the level\u201d requirement for range trades.\n  - Selling: Similarly, not at resistance; we\u2019d be shorting into the middle, not the edge.\n- Per rules, range trades must be taken at the edge with tight, structural stops. That\u2019s not the case here.\n\nC) Counter-trend mid-range reversal (requires all 3 confluences)\nWe are mid-range, so this protocol would apply, but:\n  1) RSI extreme? No (\u224836, not <30 or >70).\n  2) MACD divergence? Tool output shows consistent negative momentum; no clear divergence.\n  3) Structural retest (2+ rejections) at current level? No; rejections are around 4185 and 4220\u20134225, not here.\n\u2192 All three confluences are not present; counter-trend mid-range trade is prohibited.\n\nD) R:R and risk sizing\n- Any trade from ~4206 with a structurally sound SL (below 4183 for longs, above 4230 for shorts) and logical TP (4185 or 4220+ depending on direction) either:\n  - Violates the \u201center at the level, not mid-range\u201d rule, or\n  - Forces an optimistic TP beyond the next clear structure to reach \u22651.5 R:R, which we are not allowed to do.\n- Therefore, no candidate setup passes the R:R gatekeeper in a way that also respects entry location rules.\n\n6) Checkpoints\n\nCheckpoint 1: Post-loss cooldown\n- Not in cooldown. Pass.\n\nCheckpoint 2: R:R Gatekeeper\n- From current mid-range price, any structurally valid SL/TP that respects our strategy does not yield a clean, rule-compliant \u22651.5:1 R:R entry from here.\n- So: REJECTED: No current setup with R:R \u2265 1.5:1 that obeys structural and entry rules.\n\nCheckpoint 3: Lot size & risk\n- Not reached because we already fail Checkpoint 2.\n\nConclusion:\n- Market remains in a moderate-tempo range.\n- Price is still mid-range, not at key support/resistance.\n- Indicators show mild bearish pressure but no extremes or divergence.\n- No valid, high-probability setup that meets R:R and structural rules from the current location.\n\nPer the Prime Directive (capital preservation) and the strategy constraints, I must HOLD and wait for price to approach 4185\u20134190 or 4220\u20134225 before committing risk.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 15%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Price remains mid-range in a moderate-tempo environment with no structurally sound setup at the edges and no valid R:R \u2265 1.5:1 trade, so staying flat best preserves capital."

    "content": "Market analysis:\n\n1) Price action and tempo (15m)\n- Latest 15m candle: open 4206.43, high 4211.07, low 4206.11, close 4206.65.\n- Recent candles around 4206\u20134210 show very tight ranges and small bodies.\n- Daily context (same as prior): high 4230.31, low 4163.47, reference close 4213.46. Current price ~4206 is near the daily VWAP (4205.2), in the middle of the broader range.\n- Volatility: candles are smaller than earlier in the session; price is compressing around 4205\u20134210.\n\u2192 Tempo classification: LOW to LOW-MODERATE. This is a choppy, consolidating environment, not a strong trend or breakout.\n\n2) Indicators (minute-based)\n- MACD:\n  - MACD value is negative, signal also negative; histogram recently turned positive but is small and now slightly negative again.\n  - This reflects fading momentum and indecision rather than a clear trend.\n- RSI:\n  - Latest RSI \u2248 41 (recently oscillating roughly 38\u201360).\n  - Not overbought or oversold; neutral to mildly bearish.\n\n3) Structure and levels (from 15m)\n- Support:\n  - 4185\u20134190: repeated cluster of lows and bounces.\n  - Stronger: 4163\u20134170 (session low).\n- Resistance:\n  - 4218\u20134225: repeated rejections and local highs.\n  - Above: ~4230\u20134231 daily high.\n- Current price ~4206 is again mid-range between 4185 support and 4220\u20134225 resistance, and also near VWAP.\n\n4) Account and risk\n- Balance: $85.36\n- Risk tier: 15% (balance < $100)\n- Max risk per trade: 85.36 \u00d7 0.15 \u2248 $12.80\n- No open positions; no recent loss \u2192 no post-loss lockout.\n\n5) Strategy rule check\n\nA) Tempo mode\n- Tempo is LOW/LOW-MODERATE.\n- Rules: in low tempo, be conservative; default to HOLD, avoid forcing trades.\n\nB) Range trading at edges (Sniper Mode)\n- To buy: ideal near 4185\u20134190 with SL just below 4183, TP toward 4218\u20134225 (clear edge-to-edge idea).\n- To sell: ideal near 4220\u20134225 with SL above 4230, TP toward 4190.\n- We are not at either edge; we are mid-range around 4206.\n- Entry must be AT the level (support/resistance) with tight, structural stops. Entering here would violate that requirement.\n\nC) Counter-trend mid-range reversal (requires 3 confluences)\n- RSI extreme (<30 or >70)? No.\n- MACD divergence? Data shows small shifts but no clear divergence pattern from the tool output.\n- Structural retest (2+ rejections) at current level? No; rejections are concentrated near 4185 and 4220\u20134225, not at 4206.\n\u2192 All three confluences are not present; counter-trend mid-range trades are prohibited.\n\nD) R:R and risk sizing\n- Any trade from ~4206 with a structurally sound SL (below 4183 / above 4230) and logical TP (next support/resistance) either:\n  - Enters mid-range instead of at the level, violating entry rules, or\n  - Forces TP beyond a logical structural target just to meet \u22651.5:1, which is not allowed.\n- So, even if some raw R:R could be engineered, it would not be structurally valid per the rules.\n\n6) Checkpoints\n\nCheckpoint 1: Post-loss cooldown\n- Not in cooldown. Pass.\n\nCheckpoint 2: R:R Gatekeeper\n- No candidate trade from current price satisfies both structural SL/TP placement and \u22651.5:1 R:R.\n- REJECTED: No valid setup with R:R \u2265 1.5:1 that respects structure and entry rules.\n\nCheckpoint 3: Lot size & risk\n- Not reached, as we already fail Checkpoint 2.\n\nConclusion:\n- Market is quieting into low-tempo consolidation around VWAP.\n- Price is mid-range, not at a clear edge.\n- Indicators are neutral; no extremes, no divergence-based reversal.\n- Per Prime Directive and low-tempo guidance, forcing a trade here would be unjustified risk.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 15%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Low-tempo, mid-range consolidation with no edge-based or confluence-backed setup meeting \u22651.5:1 R:R, so capital is best preserved by staying flat."

    "content": "Market analysis:\n\n1) Price action and tempo (15m)\n- Latest 15m candle: open 4207.14, high 4209.26, low 4204.39, close 4209.26, volume 2016.\n- Recent several candles: all clustered 4205\u20134211 with small ranges and overlapping bodies.\n- Daily context: high 4230.31, low 4163.47, reference close 4213.46, VWAP \u2248 4205.21. Current price ~4209 is very close to VWAP and mid-range of the day.\n- No breakout beyond intraday extremes; price is consolidating in a tight band.\n\n\u2192 Tempo classification: LOW to LOW-MODERATE. Volatility is compressed; this is a choppy equilibrium zone, not a strong trend.\n\n2) Indicators (minute-based)\n- MACD:\n  - MACD value is negative but rising toward the signal; histogram has flipped positive (\u2248 +0.36 latest).\n  - This indicates short-term bullish momentum emerging from a previously bearish phase, but the magnitude is modest.\n- RSI:\n  - Latest RSI \u2248 59 (recent values mostly 36\u201359).\n  - Slightly bullish but not overbought; no extreme.\n\n3) Structure and key levels (from 15m)\n- Support:\n  - 4185\u20134190: repeated lows and bounces (clear intraday support).\n  - Stronger: 4163\u20134170 (session low).\n- Resistance:\n  - 4218\u20134225: repeated rejections and local highs.\n  - Above: ~4230\u20134231 daily high.\n- Current price ~4209 is in the middle between 4185 support and 4220\u20134225 resistance, and right around VWAP.\n\n4) Account and risk\n- Balance: $85.36\n- Risk tier: 15% (balance < $100)\n- Max risk per trade: 85.36 \u00d7 0.15 \u2248 $12.80\n- No open positions; no realized loss \u2192 no post-loss lockout.\n\n5) Strategy and setup evaluation\n\nA) Tempo mode\n- Tempo is low; rules say be conservative, default to HOLD unless a very clean edge setup appears.\n\nB) Range trading at edges (Sniper Mode)\n- Long idea: buy near 4185\u20134190 with SL just below 4183, TP toward 4218\u20134225.\n- Short idea: sell near 4220\u20134225 with SL above 4230, TP toward ~4190.\n- Current price 4209 is not at either edge; it is mid-range. Entering here would violate the requirement: \u201cEntry is AT the level (not chasing).\u201d\n\nC) Counter-trend mid-range reversal (requires all 3 confluences)\n- RSI extreme? No (\u224859, not >70 or <30).\n- MACD divergence? Data shows a normal momentum shift, not a clear divergence.\n- Structural retest at current level? No; the multi-touch zones are 4185 and 4220\u20134225, not 4209.\n\u2192 Conditions for counter-trend mid-range trade are not met; such trades are prohibited.\n\nD) R:R and risk\n- Any trade from ~4209 with a proper structural SL (below 4183 or above 4230) and logical TP (next support/resistance) either:\n  - Enters mid-range instead of at the edge (breaking rules), or\n  - Forces an unrealistic TP beyond the next clear level just to reach \u22651.5:1 R:R.\n- Therefore, no structurally valid, high-probability setup from this price.\n\n6) Checkpoints\n\nCheckpoint 1: Post-loss cooldown\n- Not in cooldown. Pass.\n\nCheckpoint 2: R:R Gatekeeper\n- No candidate trade from current level satisfies both structural SL/TP placement and \u22651.5:1 R:R.\n- REJECTED: No valid setup meeting the minimum R:R requirement.\n\nCheckpoint 3: Lot size & risk\n- Not reached, because we already fail Checkpoint 2 and entry-location rules.\n\nConclusion:\n- Market is in low-tempo consolidation around VWAP and mid-range.\n- Price is not at a key support or resistance edge.\n- Indicators show mild bullishness but no extreme or divergence-based opportunity.\n- Per Prime Directive and low-tempo guidance, forcing a trade here would be unjustified risk.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 15%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Low-tempo mid-range consolidation with no edge-based or confluence-backed setup meeting \u22651.5:1 R:R, so preserving capital by staying flat is optimal."

    "content": "Market analysis:\n\n1) Price action and tempo (15m)\n- Latest 15m candle: open 4211.13, high 4221.00, low 4209.91, close 4216.53, volume 2684.\n- This candle broke above the prior tight 4205\u20134210 consolidation and pushed into the 4216\u20134221 zone.\n- Daily context: high 4230.31, low 4163.47, reference close 4213.46, VWAP \u2248 4205.21. Current price ~4216.5 is above VWAP and approaching the known resistance band 4218\u20134225, but still below the daily high.\n\n\u2192 Tempo classification: HIGHER than before, moving from low/moderate into a more impulsive, bullish move. However, we are entering a resistance zone, not a clean breakout beyond it.\n\n2) Indicators (minute-based)\n- MACD:\n  - Strongly positive and rising; histogram > 0 and expanding (latest \u2248 +0.005 after a strong run; prior values up to ~+0.8).\n  - Confirms strong short-term bullish momentum.\n- RSI:\n  - Recent values peaked above 70\u201376 and have now cooled slightly to ~61.\n  - This indicates the market was overbought on the thrust up into 4220 and is now easing, but still elevated.\n\n3) Structure and key levels\n- Support:\n  - 4185\u20134190: well-defined intraday support.\n  - Stronger: 4163\u20134170 (session low).\n- Resistance:\n  - 4218\u20134225: repeated rejections and local highs; we are just below/inside this zone now.\n  - Above: ~4230\u20134231 daily high.\n- Current price ~4216.5 sits right below the 4218\u20134225 resistance band that has repeatedly capped price.\n\n4) Account and risk\n- Balance: $85.36\n- Risk tier: 15% (balance < $100)\n- Max risk per trade: 85.36 \u00d7 0.15 \u2248 $12.80\n- No open positions; no realized losses \u2192 no post-loss lockout.\n\n5) Strategy evaluation\n\nA) Tempo mode\n- We see a strong upward impulse, but price is running directly into a well-defined resistance band (4218\u20134225) and is still inside the broader daily range.\n- This is not yet a clean breakout beyond the range; it is a test of resistance.\n- Given our rules, we must be cautious about treating this as a high-tempo trend continuation because we are at/near the range edge, not in the middle of a breakout.\n\nB) Range trading at edges (Sniper Mode)\n- Short idea (sell resistance):\n  - Ideal entry: 4218\u20134220 area (top of current thrust, within resistance band).\n  - Structural SL: above 4230 (beyond daily high and clear invalidation of the range-sell idea).\n  - Logical TP: toward 4190 (support cluster).\n  - From a hypothetical entry at 4220:\n    - SL at 4231 \u2192 SL distance = 11 points.\n    - TP at 4190 \u2192 TP distance = 30 points.\n    - R:R = 30 / 11 \u2248 2.73:1 \u2192 passes R:R \u2265 1.5 requirement.\n- However, our current last close is 4216.5, not 4220+. The rule says: \u201cEntry is AT the level (not chasing).\u201d\n  - If we sell now at 4216.5 with SL 4231 and TP 4190:\n    - SL distance = 14.5 points.\n    - TP distance = 26.5 points.\n    - R:R = 26.5 / 14.5 \u2248 1.83:1 \u2192 still \u2265 1.5, but entry is not exactly at the resistance edge; it\u2019s slightly below.\n  - The structural idea is still \u201csell resistance,\u201d but we are entering a bit early. Given the recent strong bullish impulse and MACD/RSI strength, fading this move before it actually tags the resistance band is aggressive and borderline counter-trend.\n\nC) Counter-trend rules in higher tempo\n- The recent move is a strong upward impulse (bullish). In high-tempo conditions, counter-trend trades are prohibited; only pullbacks in the direction of the trend are allowed.\n- Here, a sell at 4216.5\u20134220 would be counter to the immediate bullish impulse.\n- Even though the overall daily structure is a range, the immediate 15m trend is clearly up.\n- Combined with RSI having just been overbought and MACD strongly positive, shorting now would be a pure fade of momentum, which conflicts with the \u201cno counter-trend in high tempo\u201d rule.\n\nD) Long breakout idea?\n- Buying here would mean:\n  - Entry ~4216.5.\n  - SL below 4210 or deeper (e.g., below 4205 or 4198) for structural safety.\n  - TP above 4230 (new highs).\n- But we are buying directly into a well-defined resistance band (4218\u20134225) that has capped price repeatedly. Structural TP would have to be significantly above 4230 to get R:R \u2265 1.5, which becomes speculative.\n- This does not satisfy the \u201cTP at the next logical liquidity pool/resistance\u201d rule without stretching targets.\n\nConclusion on setups:\n- Shorting: good R:R on paper, but violates the \u201cno counter-trend in high tempo\u201d guidance and is early relative to the resistance edge.\n- Buying: trades into resistance with questionable structural R:R and poor location.\n- Therefore, despite apparent opportunity, the rule set and capital-preservation focus argue strongly to WAIT and see if:\n  - Price rejects clearly from 4218\u20134225 and tempo slows (then a range short could be considered), or\n  - Price breaks and holds above 4230 with momentum (then trend-following longs on pullbacks become valid).\n\n6) Checkpoints\n\nCheckpoint 1: Post-loss cooldown\n- Not in cooldown. Pass.\n\nCheckpoint 2: R:R Gatekeeper\n- A mathematically valid R:R \u2265 1.5 exists for a range short, but it would be counter-trend in a high-tempo bullish impulse and slightly early relative to the resistance edge. The strategy disallows such counter-trend trades in this tempo context.\n- So, even though R:R passes, the trade is invalid per directional/tempo rules.\n\nCheckpoint 3: Lot size & risk\n- Not reached, because no trade passes the directional/tempo constraints.\n\nFinal decision:\n- Strong short-term bullish momentum is pushing into a known resistance band.\n- Our rules prohibit counter-trend fading in high-tempo conditions and discourage buying directly into resistance without a clean breakout and pullback structure.\n- To protect capital, the correct action is to HOLD and wait for clearer structure (either rejection from 4218\u20134225 or a confirmed breakout above 4230 and retest).\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 15%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Strong bullish impulse is testing resistance, but rules prohibit counter-trend shorts in high tempo and buying into resistance lacks a clean structural R:R, so staying flat best preserves capital."

There was a brief high-tempo push up, but now price is pausing under resistance rather than exploding further.\n\n2) Indicators (minute-based)\n- MACD:\n  - MACD value remains positive but is declining toward the signal; histogram is negative and widening (latest \u2248 -0.64).\n  - This shows bullish momentum has peaked and is now fading.\n- RSI:\n  - Recently peaked in the mid-60s; now cooled to ~48.\n  - No longer overbought; neutral to slightly bullish.\n\n3) Structure and key levels\n- Support:\n  - 4185\u20134190: well-defined intraday support cluster.\n  - Stronger: 4163\u20134170 (session low).\n- Resistance:\n  - 4218\u20134225: multiple prior rejections; current highs are testing the lower part of this band (today\u2019s recent high 4221).\n  - Above: ~4230\u20134231 daily high.\n- Current price ~4215 is just beneath the 4218\u20134220 resistance zone and below the recent high at 4221.\n\n4) Account and risk\n- Balance: $85.36\n- Risk tier: 15% (balance < $100)\n- Max risk per trade: 85.36 \u00d7 0.15 \u2248 $12.80\n- No open positions; no realized losses \u2192 no post-loss lockout.\n\n5) Strategy evaluation\n\nA) Tempo and directional context\n- Immediate 15m trend is still up from the 4185\u20134190 base, but momentum is clearly slowing as price presses into resistance.\n- Tempo is now moderate, not clearly high. That allows range trading if we are at an edge and meet R:R and structure rules.\n\nB) Range short at resistance (Sniper Mode)\nWe are very close to the range top:\n\nCandidate setup:\n- Direction: SELL (fade resistance).\n- Entry: around current price 4215.4 (just under resistance band 4218\u20134220).\n- Stop Loss (SL): above daily high and resistance, e.g. 4231.0 (beyond 4230.31).\n- Take Profit (TP): toward support zone, e.g. 4190.0.\n\nR:R calculation (SELL):\n- Entry \u2248 4215.4\n- TP = 4190.0 \u2192 TP distance = 4215.4 - 4190.0 = 25.4 points\n- SL = 4231.0 \u2192 SL distance = 4231.0 - 4215.4 = 15.6 points\n- R:R = TP_distance / SL_distance = 25.4 / 15.6 \u2248 1.63:1 \u2192 passes \u2265 1.5 requirement.\n\nLocation and structure:\n- Entry is slightly below the 4218\u20134220 resistance band, not at its absolute top, but price has already wicked into 4219.6 and pulled back, indicating sellers above.\n- We have:\n  - Clear resistance overhead (4218\u20134225).\n  - Logical invalidation above 4230/4231.\n  - Logical TP at the 4190 support cluster.\n- Tempo is moderate, not high, and MACD/RSI show waning bullish momentum.\n- This is a range fade at the upper third of the range with acceptable structure and R:R.\n\nC) Counter-trend rules\n- Is this counter-trend? The microtrend is up, but the broader intraday structure is a range 4185\u20134230. We are fading the move at the range top, which is allowed in moderate tempo Sniper Mode, provided R:R \u2265 2:1 ideally, but rules specify \u2265 1.5:1 as the hard minimum and \u2265 2:1 for ideal range fades.\n- We have 1.63:1, above the minimum. It\u2019s not perfect 2:1, but within the allowed rules, and the structure is clear.\n\nD) Checkpoints\n\nCheckpoint 1: Post-loss cooldown\n- Not in cooldown. Pass.\n\nCheckpoint 2: R:R Gatekeeper\n- For SELL at 4215.4 with TP 4190 and SL 4231:\n  - R:R \u2248 1.63:1 \u2265 1.5.\n- Pass.\n\nCheckpoint 3: Lot size & risk validation\n- Balance: $85.36\n- Risk tier: 15%\n- Max Risk_USD = 85.36 \u00d7 0.15 \u2248 $12.80\n- Stop distance: 4231.0 - 4215.4 = 15.6 points\n\nAssume pip/point value for XAUUSD \u2248 $1.00 per point per 0.01 lot (per instructions).\n\nRisk per 0.01 lot:\n- Risk_0.01 = 15.6 points \u00d7 $1.00 \u2248 $15.60\n\nThis exceeds our max risk $12.80, so 0.01 lot is too large at this stop distance.\n\nWe must reduce lot size:\n- Required lot size = Max_Risk_USD / (Stop_Distance \u00d7 Pip_Value_per_0.01)\n- = 12.80 / 15.6 \u2248 0.82 (in units of 0.01 lot) \u2192 0.0082 lots.\n- Brokers typically have a minimum of 0.01 lot, and we must not round up.\n- Since 0.01 lot already exceeds the max risk, and we cannot go smaller than 0.01, this trade is not viable under our risk constraints with a structurally correct stop.\n\nWe could try tightening SL closer, but that would:\n- Move SL inside the resistance band, no longer at a clear invalidation beyond the swing high/daily high.\n- That would violate the structural SL rule.\n\nTherefore, despite a structurally valid concept and acceptable R:R, the minimum tradable lot size (0.01) would risk more than our allowed 15%, and tightening the stop to fit risk would break structure.\n\nPer rules, if Actual Risk > Max Risk and cannot be reduced by decreasing lot size (due to broker/minimum), we must HOLD.\n\nConclusion:\n- Setup idea: short near resistance with good R:R and structure.\n- However, with our small account and the structural stop required, even the smallest lot size (0.01) risks more than our allowed 15%.\n- We are not allowed to violate risk limits or compromise structural SL placement.\n\nTherefore, no trade can be executed safely right now.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 15%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: A potential short at resistance has acceptable R:R, but the structural stop distance makes even the minimum 0.01 lot exceed the 15% risk limit, so no trade is viable without breaking risk or structure rules."

We are in a controlled range near the upper band.\n\n2) Indicators (minute-based)\n- MACD:\n  - MACD has recently crossed below its signal; histogram is negative (latest \u2248 -0.03 to -0.1).\n  - This shows short-term bullish momentum has faded and is slightly tilting bearish.\n- RSI:\n  - Latest RSI \u2248 54\u201355 (recent values mostly low-40s to high-50s).\n  - Neutral to mildly bullish; no overbought/oversold extremes.\n\n3) Structure and key levels\n- Support:\n  - 4185\u20134190: intraday support cluster.\n  - Stronger: 4163\u20134170 session low.\n- Resistance:\n  - 4218\u20134225: repeated rejections; current highs into 4218\u20134219 confirm this band.\n  - Above: 4230\u20134231 daily high.\n- Current price ~4216.5 is just under the 4218\u20134220 resistance zone and below 4225.\n\n4) Account and risk\n- Balance: $85.36\n- Risk tier: 15% (balance < $100)\n- Max risk per trade: 85.36 \u00d7 0.15 \u2248 $12.80\n- No open positions; no realized losses \u2192 no post-loss cooldown.\n\n5) Strategy evaluation\n\nA) Context\n- We are near the upper edge of an established range (resistance 4218\u20134225).\n- Momentum is no longer strongly bullish; MACD is softening, RSI neutral.\n- Tempo is moderate, which allows range trading (Sniper Mode) if R:R and structure are sound.\n\nB) Range short at resistance\nCandidate idea:\n- SELL near current price (4216.5), targeting the 4190 support area.\n\nStructural levels:\n- Entry: 4216.5 (current area).\n- SL: above daily high/clear invalidation, e.g. 4231.0 (beyond 4230.31).\n- TP: 4190.0 (support cluster).\n\nR:R (SELL):\n- TP distance = 4216.5 - 4190.0 = 26.5 points.\n- SL distance = 4231.0 - 4216.5 = 14.5 points.\n- R:R = 26.5 / 14.5 \u2248 1.83:1 \u2192 passes \u2265 1.5 minimum.\n\nThis is a valid range-fade concept structurally and by R:R.\n\nC) Risk and lot size constraint\n- Max risk: $12.80.\n- Stop distance: 14.5 points.\n- Pip value: \u2248 $1.00 per point per 0.01 lot (per instructions).\n\nRisk per 0.01 lot:\n- 14.5 points \u00d7 $1.00 \u2248 $14.50 risk.\n\nThis exceeds the allowed $12.80. We must compute the maximum allowable lot:\n\nRequired lot size (in 0.01-lot units):\n- 12.80 / 14.5 \u2248 0.883 \u2192 0.00883 lots.\n\nWe must not round up and typical minimum tradable size is 0.01 lot. Since:\n- 0.01 lot risk ($14.50) > max allowed ($12.80)\n- And we cannot go below 0.01 lot,\n\nThis trade cannot be executed without violating our risk cap.\n\nTightening SL to fit 0.01 lot inside risk would push SL inside the resistance band and no longer at a true invalidation point, breaking the structural SL rule. That is not allowed.\n\nD) Long breakout?\n- Buying here would be directly into resistance 4218\u20134225, with SL likely below 4210/4205 and TP above 4230.\n- To get \u22651.5:1 R:R, TP would need to be set well above the next logical resistance (4230), which is speculative and not permitted by structure-based TP rules.\n- So no valid long setup either.\n\n6) Checkpoints\n\nCheckpoint 1: Post-loss cooldown\n- Not in cooldown. Pass.\n\nCheckpoint 2: R:R Gatekeeper\n- Range short concept: R:R \u2248 1.83:1 \u2192 passes.\n- However, risk constraints at minimum lot size cannot be met; this effectively invalidates the trade for our account.\n\nCheckpoint 3: Lot size & risk\n- With structural SL, 0.01 lot risks ~$14.50 > $12.80 max.\n- We cannot reduce below 0.01 lot.\n- Therefore, Actual Risk would be above Max Risk \u2192 trade must be rejected.\n\nConclusion:\n- Structurally, a short near resistance is attractive, but with our small account and proper structural stop, the minimum lot risks too much.\n- No other setup (long or short) satisfies both R:R and risk constraints with valid structure.\n\nPer Prime Directive and risk rules, I must not force a trade.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 15%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Although a short at resistance has acceptable R:R, the structural stop distance makes even the minimum 0.01 lot exceed the 15% risk cap, so no trade is allowed without violating risk or structure rules."
