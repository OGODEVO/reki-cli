Risk is capped at \u2248$6\u20137 (<20% tier max) with a projected reward ~1.5\u00d7 the risk, consistent with the intraday scalping and range-fade rules under moderate tempo conditions.\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4195.53\nTP: 4207.8\nSL: 4193.8\nREASON: Existing long is in profit and aligned with improving momentum (MACD hist > 0, RSI ~52) while price remains between defined support (4194.5) and resistance (4205\u20134210); adding exposure mid-range would degrade R:R and violate edge criteria. Best action is to hold the current position toward the pre-defined TP near the upper liquidity zone and reassess at the next cycle.\nDECISION: HOLD (NO NEW TRADE)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A (flat)\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nREASON: The prior long has been closed at a strong reward relative to account size, and current price sits in the middle of the intraday range with neutral RSI and already-positive MACD, offering no clear edge for either a range fade or breakout trend-follow. Remaining flat preserves the realized gain and avoids overtrading a mid-range, moderate-tempo environment.\nDECISION: BUY (already executed)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: ~4197.8\nTP: 4207.8\nSL: 4193.8\nREASON: Long taken at lower range edge near 4194\u20134196 support with RSI 37 and moderating do...\nDECISION: SELL (already executed)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: ~4202.0\nTP: 4194.0\nSL: 4205.0\nREASON: Entered a range-fade short near the upper half of the established 4194\u20134210 band with flat-to-down M15 slope and maturing upside momentum, targeting a rotation back toward support. The setup offers R:R > 1.5:1 with dollar risk well below the 20% tier cap, aligning with the intraday scalping and adaptive aggression rules under moderate tempo.\nDECISION: BUY (already executed)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: ~4197.8\nTP: 4207.8\nSL: 4193.8\nREASON: Long taken at lower range edge near 4194\u20134196 support with RSI 37 and moderating do...\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nREASON: Account is coming off a loss and price is trading in the upper-middle of the 4195\u20134210 range with strong bullish momentum and no clear rejection at resistance, so neither a range fade nor a breakout entry offers a clean, high-R:R setup. Staying flat respects both the post-loss cooling logic and the requirement to trade only at range edges or on well-defined momentum breaks.\nDECISION: BUY (already executed)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: ~4197.8\nTP: 4207.8\nSL: 4193.8\nREASON: Long taken at lower range edge near 4194\u20134196 support with RSI 37 and moderating do...\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nREASON: Market is mid-range between 4194.5 support and 4207\u20134210 resistance with neutral RSI and only a nascent MACD rollover, providing no statistically strong edge for either a fade or a trend-follow entry. Staying flat preserves capital and keeps risk available for a higher-conviction setup at a range boundary or on a clear volatility expansion.\nDECISION: BUY (already executed)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: ~4197.8\nTP: 4207.8\nSL: 4193.8\nREASON: Long taken at lower range edge near 4194\u20134196 support with RSI 37 and moderating do...\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nREASON: With price at 4198 near but not at key support (4194\u20134195) and downside momentum still building, neither a fade nor a breakout entry provides a clean, high-R:R setup; shorting risks getting trapped into support, while longing fights current momentum without confirmation. Staying flat preserves capital and waits for a clearer edge at the true range boundary or on a confirmed breakdown.\nDECISION: BUY (already executed)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: ~4197.8\nTP: 4207.8\nSL: 4193.8\nREASON: Long taken at lower range edge near 4194\u20134196 support with RSI 37 and moderating do...\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nREASON: With price between 4194 support and 4204\u20134206 resistance and indicators showing only mild, stabilizing downside momentum (RSI ~44, MACD hist turning from deeply negative toward flat), there is no high-conviction edge for a scalp at this level. Standing aside preserves risk capital for a cleaner setup either on a direct test/rejection of 4194\u20134195 for a long, or a retest/rejection of 4204\u20134206 for a short.\nDECISION: BUY (already executed)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: ~4197.8\nTP: 4207.8\nSL: 4193.8\nREASON: Long taken at lower range edge near 4194\u20134196 support with RSI 37 and moderating do...\nDECISION: SELL\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: ~4200.0\nTP: 4193.5\nSL: 4202.5\nREASON: A mean-reversion short is opened with price recovering into the mid/upper segment of the 4194\u20134210 band while the higher-timeframe slope is flat-to-down and resistance at 4204\u20134206 sits overhead; a tight stop above the local structure and a TP back near the lower band provide >1.5 R:R with controlled dollar risk.\nDECISION: BUY (already executed)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: ~4197.8\nTP: 4207.8\nSL: 4193.8\nREASON: Long taken at lower range edge near 4194\u20134196 support with RSI 37 and moderating do...\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nREASON: Despite strong bullish momentum (RSI > 60, MACD hist > 0.6) and an upward M15 slope, price is currently crowded just beneath a well-defined resistance zone (4208\u20134210), giving limited upside vs downside for a fresh long. In high-tempo conditions the plan is to trend-follow, but only on a confirmed breakout above 4210 or a pullback to support; staying flat here avoids buying into resistance with suboptimal R:R.\nDECISION: BUY (already executed)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: ~4197.8\nTP: 4207.8\nSL: 4193.8\nREASON: Long taken at lower range edge near 4194\u20134196 support with RSI 37 and moderating do...\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nREASON: Current price is pinned at the 4208\u20134210 resistance band with MACD flattening and RSI easing from prior overbought, so neither a breakout long nor a range-fade short offers a clean, high-R:R statistical edge. Staying flat avoids buying into resistance or prematurely fading an uptrend and keeps risk available for a clearer signal on a breakout/retest or a pullback to support.\nDECISION: BUY (already executed)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: ~4197.8\nTP: 4207.8\nSL: 4193.8\nREASON: Long taken at lower range edge near 4194\u20134196 support with RSI 37 and moderating do...\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nREASON: Momentum has flipped bearish (MACD hist \u2248 -0.58, RSI ~45) after rejection from 4208\u20134210, but price now sits in the middle of the 4195\u20134210 band rather than at a high-probability edge. Entering short here risks poor R:R if price bounces from 4196\u20134198, and entering long would be counter to current momentum; waiting for a retest of 4206\u20134208 for a fade or a push into 4194\u20134196 for a potential long provides a cleaner statistical advantage.\nDECISION: BUY (already executed)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: ~4197.8\nTP: 4207.8\nSL: 4193.8\nREASON: Long taken at lower range edge near 4194\u20134196 support with RSI 37 and moderating do...\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nREASON: Market is in moderate-tempo, sideways conditions with price centered in the 4194\u20134210 range and neutral momentum (RSI ~47, MACD ~0), so any trade from 4203 would have limited profit potential before hitting nearby support/resistance while still requiring a meaningful stop. Waiting for a test of 4194\u20134198 or 4206\u20134210, or a clear breakout from this band, preserves capital for higher-conviction setups with R:R > 1.5:1.\nDECISION: BUY (already executed)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: ~4197.8\nTP: 4207.8\nSL: 4193.8\nREASON: Long taken at lower range edge near 4194\u20134196 support with RSI 37 and moderating do...\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nREASON: Market is consolidating in the middle of a well-defined 4194\u20134210 range with neutral-to-weak momentum (RSI ~53, MACD hist slightly negative), so any immediate long or short from 4202.6 would offer limited reward relative to the nearby support/resistance boundaries. Waiting for price to approach 4206\u20134210 for a potential short fade or 4194\u20134198 for a potential long fade preserves capital for higher-conviction setups with R:R > 1.5:1.\nDECISION: BUY (already executed)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: ~4197.8\nTP: 4207.8\nSL: 4193.8\nREASON: Long taken at lower range edge near 4194\u20134196 support with RSI 37 and moderating do...\nDECISION: BUY (EXECUTED)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: ~4207.5 (approx, based on last price)\nTP: 4213.5\nSL: 4204.5\nREASON: Strong bullish momentum (RSI 71, MACD hist +0.38) and high-tempo expansion from the prior 4194\u20134210 range favor a trend-follow long targeting the next liquidity pocket at 4210\u20134215. A tight stop just below the breakout structure at 4204.5 caps risk well under the allowed tier while offering roughly double the potential reward on a continuation spike into the upper band.\nDECISION: BUY (already executed)\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: ~4197.8\nTP: 4207.8\nSL: 4193.8\nREASON: Long taken at lower range edge near 4194\u20134196 support with RSI 37 and moderating do...\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: 4208.61\nTP: 4213.50\nSL: 4204.50\nREASON: Existing long is aligned with the prevailing uptrend and strong MACD, currently showing a controlled unrealized gain of \u2248$3.9 while risk remains within limits; however, price is now at the 4210 resistance pocket with RSI backing off from prior extremes, so adding or adjusting would only degrade R:R.

As an intraday scalper, the play in this state is to follow the breakout with a tight stop under the breakout shelf (\u22484208\u20134209) and target the next liquidity pocket toward 4218\u20134220, maintaining R:R > 1.5 while keeping dollar risk within the 20% tier.\n\nI will now execute a BUY trade on MT5 with these parameters.\n\nDECISION: BUY  \nSYMBOL: XAUUSD  \nENTRY: \u22484213.5 (market)  \nTP: 4219.5 (\u2248+6 pts)  \nSL: 4209.5 (\u2248-4 pts, below breakout shelf)  \nLOTS: 0.02  \nR:R: \u22481.5:1  \nRISK_TIER: 20%  \nRISK_USD: \u2248$8  \nREASON: Strong uptrend and high-tempo breakout above a well-defined 4210 resistance, with MACD histogram firmly positive and RSI elevated but not extreme, favor a continuation scalp; placing the stop just below 4209 preserves structural integrity while the 4219.5 target sits near the next logical liquidity band, yielding acceptable R:R within account risk limits."

Our long is essentially flat but still carries full downside risk into 4207\u20134209 support; the current reward from here is capped by nearby resistance while risk remains open. Statistically, closing this marginal long and waiting for either a pullback toward 4207\u20134209 or a fresh breakout above 4214 offers better R:R than holding.\n\nDECISION: CLOSE  \nSYMBOL: XAUUSD  \nENTRY: 4212.48  \nTICKET: 35667989  \nTP: N/A (cancel by close)  \nSL: N/A (cancel by close)  \nLOTS: 0.02  \nR:R: Trade exited near breakeven (tiny loss) vs initial ~3.5\u20134 pt risk  \nRISK_TIER: 20%  \nRISK_USD: \u2248$7\u20138 initial (not realized)  \nREASON: With MACD rolling over (hist -0.24), RSI neutral, and price pinned just below resistance, the upside continuation thesis is weak while full downside to 4207\u20134209 remains; exiting now crystallizes only a minor loss and preserves risk capital for a cleaner setup at support or on a decisive breakout."
