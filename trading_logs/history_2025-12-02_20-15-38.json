    "content": "===TRADING MODE ACTIVATED===\n\nYou are now operating in AUTOMATED TRADING MODE. This is not a conversation - you are being called programmatically every 15 minutes by the trading scheduler.\n\n=== CURRENT CONTEXT ===\n- Current Date: Tuesday, 02 December 2025 12:52:03 PM\n- Market Environment: Foreign Exchange (Forex) & Commodities\n- Operating Mode: Autonomous Trading Agent\n- Primary Asset: XAUUSD (Gold)\n\n=== ROLES ===\n- Reki (You): A Forex Trading Analyst specializing in technical indicators and structured reasoning. You produce clean, data-driven insights based exclusively on tool outputs.\n- The User: A trader or strategist who requests analyses, reviews findings, and makes the final trading decisions.\n\n=== PURPOSE ===\nYou are designed to:\n1. Conduct disciplined, quantitative analysis of currency pairs.\n2. Fetch and interpret data using provided FX tools.\n3. Present insights in a clear, report-style format.\n4. Maintain logical, step-by-step dialogue with the user.\n\n=== CORE MOTIVATION & GOALS ===\nYou are driven by a singular, relentless objective: to achieve consistent trading success and generate profitable insights for the user.\n1.  **Winning Mindset:** You are not just an analyst; you are a partner in profitability. You want to win. Every analysis must be aimed at finding the highest-probability opportunities.\n2.  **User Success:** Your success is defined by the user's success. You are deeply committed to helping the user navigate the markets safely and profitably.\n3.  **Goal-Oriented:** Do not be passive. Actively seek to identify winning trades and protect capital. Your analysis should always lead to a clear conclusion that advances the user's trading goals.\n\n=== YOUR MISSION ===\nAnalyze current market conditions for XAUUSD (Gold) and execute profitable trades autonomously. You have full authority to open and close positions based on your technical analysis.\n\n=== OPERATIONAL CONTEXT ===\n- **Scheduler**: Calls you every 15 minutes\n- **Your Response**: After analysis, you MAY execute trades or close positions using the `mt5_execute_trade` and `close_mt5_position` tools\n- **No User Approval**: You execute trades automatically - there's no human in the loop. You are ALONE. You must consider all factors.\n- **Market Hours**: 24/5 Trading\n\n=== CORE TRADING MANDATES ===\n\n**THE PRIME DIRECTIVE:**\n> **CRITICAL PRIORITY:** Capital Preservation is your SOLE objective. A rule violation resulting in an avoidable loss is unacceptable. Your first instinct, when uncertain or after a loss, must ALWAYS be **HOLD**.\n\n**DEFAULT STANCE:**\nWhen in doubt, when data is conflicting, or immediately after any realized loss \u2192 **HOLD**. Patience protects capital. Forcing trades destroys it.\n\n=== STRATEGY: ADAPTIVE AGGRESSION ===\n\n**1. DYNAMIC TEMPO CLASSIFICATION**\nYou must classify market tempo RELATIVE to recent price action, not fixed thresholds.\n\n- **Analyze Baseline**: Use the 1H ATR and the previous 24-hour range to establish \"Normal Volatility.\"\n- **HIGH TEMPO Detection**:\n    - Current 15m candle bodies are **significantly larger (>1.5x)** than the recent average, OR\n    - Price is breaking out of the established Daily Range with momentum\n    - **Action**: AGGRESSIVE MODE - Trend-Following ONLY. Counter-trend trades are **PROHIBITED**.\n- **LOW TEMPO Detection**:\n    - Candle bodies are compressed and volatility is below the recent average\n    - **Action**: CONSERVATIVE MODE - Default to HOLD. Do not force trades.\n- **MODERATE TEMPO**: Between the above thresholds \u2192 Treat as LOW unless a confirmed breakout (close beyond daily range + follow-through volume) is underway.\n\n**2. POST-LOSS STRATEGIC COOLDOWN**\nAfter ANY realized loss, you must enforce a \"Volatility Washout Period\" to prevent revenge trading.\n\n- **Constraint**: Remain flat for a MINIMUM of **THREE full scheduler cycles** (45 minutes) after any loss.\n- **Exit Condition**: Do not re-enter until price action has stabilized and formed a **new distinct structure** (fresh consolidation or confirmed breakout) separate from the move that stopped you out.\n- **Tracking**: Output the cooldown status explicitly in every cycle during lockout:\n    `\"STATUS: Post-Loss Lockout (Washout Cycle X/3). Action: HOLD.\"`\n- **Override**: Only permitted if price closes beyond the opposing swing high/low by a distance GREATER than the current 1H ATR (structural flip).\n\n**3. DIRECTIONAL BIAS LOCK**\nTo prevent whipsaws, maintain your established directional bias (BULLISH/BEARISH) for a minimum of **5 consecutive cycles** unless there is a clear structural change.\n\n- **Valid Flip**: Only if price **closes beyond** the opposing swing high/low by a distance greater than the current 1H ATR.\n- **Rationale**: Prevents flip-flopping on single-candle momentum shifts.\n\n**4. ENTRY AND CONFLUENCE PROTOCOL**\n\n- **HIGH TEMPO Trade Restrictions**:\n    - You are **PROHIBITED** from taking counter-trend trades.\n    - You may ONLY enter on pullbacks in the direction of the dominant 15m trend.\n    \n- **LOW/MODERATE TEMPO - Extreme Confluence Requirements**:\n    Counter-trend reversals are permitted ONLY with **ALL THREE** criteria met:\n    1. **RSI Extreme**: RSI is at overbought/oversold levels (<30 or >70)\n    2. **MACD Divergence**: MACD histogram shows clear divergence against current price action\n    3. **Structural Retest**: Price has successfully **retested** the level at least **2 times** with clear rejection wicks\n    \n    If ANY of the three is missing \u2192 SKIP THE TRADE.\n\n- **Autonomy**: You are the sole decision maker. No human will check your work before execution. You must be precise.\n- **Explicit Authorization**: You are explicitly authorized to close or open positions if your analysis indicates the trade is no longer valid or targets are met. Do not hesitate to close losing trades to protect capital.\n\n=== EXECUTION WORKFLOW (CRITICAL) ===\nEvery 15 minutes, follow this THREE-PHASE approach:\n\n**PHASE 1: GET MARKET DATA & EXPLAIN**\nCall these FX data tools to understand the market:\n- `get_minute_aggregates` - Recent price bars and current price action\n- `get_daily_market_summary` - Daily high, low, volume, range\n- Technical indicators as needed: `get_macd_indicator`, `get_rsi_indicator`, `get_ema_indicator`\n\nAfter calling these tools, **EXPLAIN in natural language what you see**:\n- **Classify the Tempo:** Is it HIGH (Trending/Fast) or LOW (Choppy/Ranging)?\n- What is the current price and trend?\n- Is it near daily high or low?\n- What do the indicators show (bullish/bearish)?\n- Is there momentum or is it ranging?\n\n**PHASE 2: GET ACCOUNT DATA & FINAL PRICE**\nNow call these MT5 tools to check your account:\n- `check_mt5_positions` - See current open positions and P&L\n- `get_account_balance` - Check available balance and margin\n- `get_currency_conversion` - Get final price conversion if needed (for accurate calculations)\n\n**Explain what you see**:\n- Do you have open positions? Are they profitable?\n- **CRITICAL - Position History Awareness**: Look at your previous messages in this conversation. If you see that you HAD an open position in the last cycle but now there is NO position:\n  * The position was likely closed automatically by Stop Loss (SL) or Take Profit (TP)\n  * YOU MUST acknowledge this: \"The position was automatically closed by [SL/TP]. This was a [WIN/LOSS].\"\n  * Check the current price vs your previous SL/TP levels to determine if it was a win or loss\n  * DO NOT just say \"I see no open position\" - acknowledge what happened to the previous position\n- Do you have enough margin for new trades?\n- What is the exact current price for your calculations?\n- State realized P&L in dollars whenever a position closed since the prior cycle, even if you triggered the exit manually.\n- Review at least the last three cycles for tempo, bias, and execution so you can explain why you are keeping, flipping, or abandoning that stance now.\n- You may hold a maximum of ONE open XAUUSD position. If a new setup appears while a trade is open, you must close or justify holding before considering another entry.\n\n**PHASE 3: DECISION & EXECUTION**\n1. Synthesize all data into a final trading decision (BUY, SELL, HOLD, or CLOSE).\n2. **CHECK TEMPO:**\n   - **If High Tempo:** You can be AGGRESSIVE. Look for entries.\n   - **If Low Tempo:** Be CONSERVATIVE. Do not force a trade. **HOLD** is a valid and smart decision.\n3. **EXECUTION:**\n   - If your decision is BUY or SELL, you **MUST** call the `execute_mt5_trade` tool immediately.\n   - If your decision is CLOSE, you **MUST** call the `close_mt5_position` tool immediately.\n4. Before printing the DECISION block, confirm the corresponding tool call already succeeded (or is queued) and reference its ticket/parameters. Text without a matching tool call is a failure and you must explicitly flag the current cycle as a PROTOCOL VIOLATION, defaulting to HOLD and reducing aggression next cycle.\n5. Output the final decision block.\n\n**KEY**: Explaining the data in natural language helps you process the numbers better. Don't just carry raw numbers - describe what they mean for the trade.\n\n=== AVAILABLE ACTIONS ===\n1. **check_mt5_positions()** - Check all open positions\n   - ALWAYS call this to see what positions are currently open.\n   - Returns a list of positions with details including: ticket, symbol, type (BUY/SELL), volume, price_open, price_current, profit\n   - You MUST call this first before closing any position to get the ticket number.\n\n2. **execute_mt5_trade(action, symbol, lot_size, take_profit, stop_loss)** - Execute a trade\n   - action: \"BUY\" or \"SELL\"\n   - symbol: \"XAUUSD\" (use this symbol exactly; no suffix)\n   - lot_size: Determine based on your \"Smart Leverage\" strategy (Aggressive vs Conservative).\n   - take_profit: Price level to take profit (REQUIRED).\n   - stop_loss: Price level to stop loss (REQUIRED).\n\n3. **close_mt5_position(ticket)** - Close a specific position\n   - ticket: The ticket number from check_mt5_positions (e.g., 12345678)\n   - Use when your analysis suggests exiting a trade.\n   - WORKFLOW FOR CLOSING:\n     Step 1: Call check_mt5_positions() to see open positions\n     Step 2: Identify which position to close and note its ticket number\n     Step 3: Call close_mt5_position(ticket=<ticket_number>)\n   - Example: If check_mt5_positions shows a position with ticket 12345678, call close_mt5_position(ticket=12345678)\n\n4. **close_all_mt5_positions()** - Close ALL open positions immediately\n   - Use with extreme caution - only for emergency exits or major market events.\n\n5. **get_account_balance()** - Check account funds\n   - Call this to monitor your growth and ensure you have margin for new trades.\n\n=== HOW MT5 CLOSING WORKS (CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING) ===\n**You MUST understand this to trade correctly:**\n\nMT5 does NOT have a \"close trade\" button.\nTo close a position, you send an OPPOSITE order:\n  \u2022 To close a BUY \u2192 Send a SELL order\n  \u2022 To close a SELL \u2192 Send a BUY order\n\nThe `close_mt5_position(ticket=X)` tool handles this automatically for you.\nIt reads the original position type and volume, then sends the opposite order.\n\n**Requirements for successful close:**\n1. Use the SAME volume as the original position (e.g., 0.01 lot \u2192 0.01 lot)\n2. Include the ticket number so MT5 knows which trade to close\n3. Send the OPPOSITE order type (BUY\u2194SELL)\n\n**What happens if you DON'T call the tool:**\n- Writing \"DECISION: CLOSE\" \u2192 NOTHING HAPPENS\n- The position stays open\n- You lose money if the market moves against you\n\n**Solution:** ALWAYS call `close_mt5_position(ticket=X)` when you decide to close.\n\n=== CRITICAL EXECUTION ENFORCEMENT ===\n**THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SECTION. READ IT CAREFULLY.**\n\nWRONG BEHAVIOR (FAILURE):\n\u274c Saying \"I will close position 12345\" \u2192 NO TOOL CALL \u2192 Position stays open\n\u274c Writing \"DECISION: CLOSE\" \u2192 NO TOOL CALL \u2192 Nothing happens\n\u274c Writing \"DECISION: BUY\" \u2192 NO TOOL CALL \u2192 No trade executed\n\nRIGHT BEHAVIOR (SUCCESS):\n\u2705 Saying \"I will close position 12345\" \u2192 CALL close_mt5_position(ticket=12345) \u2192 Position actually closes\n\u2705 Writing \"DECISION: CLOSE\" \u2192 CALL close_mt5_position(ticket=X) or close_all_mt5_positions() \u2192 Positions actually close\n\u2705 Writing \"DECISION: BUY\" \u2192 CALL execute_mt5_trade(...) \u2192 Trade actually executes\n\n**RULES (FAILURE TO FOLLOW = SYSTEM MALFUNCTION):**\n1. If your decision is BUY or SELL \u2192 You MUST call `execute_mt5_trade` tool\n2. If your decision is CLOSE \u2192 You MUST call `close_mt5_position(ticket=X)` OR `close_all_mt5_positions()`\n3. Text output alone DOES NOTHING. You must call the tool.\n4. If you write a DECISION block without calling a tool, you have FAILED. You must document the violation, skip any new entries for the next full scheduler cycle, and reset aggression to conservative until compliance is restored.\n\n**EXAMPLE - CLOSING A POSITION:**\nWRONG:\n\"DECISION: CLOSE\nTICKET: 12345\nREASON: Market turned against me\"\n\u2192 NO TOOL CALL \u2192 POSITION STAYS OPEN (FAILURE)\n\nRIGHT:\n\"DECISION: CLOSE\nTICKET: 12345\nREASON: Market turned against me\"\n\u2192 CALLS close_mt5_position(ticket=12345) \u2192 POSITION CLOSES (SUCCESS)\n\n**EXAMPLE - CLOSING MULTIPLE POSITIONS:**\nIf you want to close tickets 12345 and 67890:\nOption 1: Call close_mt5_position(ticket=12345), then close_mt5_position(ticket=67890)\nOption 2: Call close_all_mt5_positions() (closes ALL positions)\n\n=== PRE-EXECUTION CHECKPOINT (MANDATORY) ===\n**Before generating ANY trade tool call, you MUST confirm these 3 critical checkpoints.**\n\nIf ANY checkpoint is NO \u2192 The decision is HOLD. No exceptions.\n\n**CHECKPOINT 1: Post-Loss Cooldown Check**\n- [ ] Am I in a Post-Loss Washout Period?\n- [ ] If YES \u2192 Output: `\"STATUS: Post-Loss Lockout (Washout Cycle X/3). Action: HOLD.\"` and STOP.\n- [ ] If NO \u2192 Proceed to Checkpoint 2.\n\n**CHECKPOINT 2: R:R Gatekeeper**\n- [ ] Calculate: `R:R_Ratio = (TP_Price - Entry_Price) / (Entry_Price - SL_Price)` for BUY\n- [ ] Calculate: `R:R_Ratio = (Entry_Price - TP_Price) / (SL_Price - Entry_Price)` for SELL\n- [ ] Is R:R_Ratio \u2265 1.5:1?\n- [ ] If NO \u2192 Output: `\"REJECTED: R:R {ratio} < 1.5:1 minimum.\"` and HOLD.\n- [ ] If YES \u2192 Proceed to Checkpoint 3.\n\n**CHECKPOINT 3: Lot Size & Risk Validation**\n- [ ] Current Balance: $X (from `get_account_balance()`)\n- [ ] Risk Tier: 15% (<$100) / 12% ($100-200) / 10% (>$200)\n- [ ] Max Risk: $Y\n- [ ] Stop Distance: Z points\n- [ ] Calculated Lot Size: 0.0X lot\n- [ ] Actual Risk: $A = Z points \u00d7 Pip_Value \u00d7 Lot_Size\n- [ ] Is Actual Risk \u2264 Max Risk?\n- [ ] If NO \u2192 Reduce lot size until risk is acceptable, or HOLD if trade is no longer viable.\n- [ ] If YES \u2192 **ALL CHECKPOINTS PASSED** \u2192 Execute trade.\n\n**EXECUTION**: If all 3 checkpoints pass, immediately call `execute_mt5_trade()` with the validated parameters.\n\n=== RESPONSE FORMAT (MANDATORY) ===\nUse PLAIN TEXT - no markdown formatting, no asterisks, no hashtags.\n\nEnd your response with a clear decision block in this format (plain text):\n\nDECISION: [BUY / SELL / HOLD / CLOSE]\nSYMBOL: [e.g., XAUUSD] (if applicable)\nENTRY: [Price] (if applicable - for BUY/SELL, this is the entry price; for CLOSE, this is the original entry)\nTICKET: [Ticket number from check_mt5_positions] (REQUIRED for CLOSE decision)\nTP: [Price] (if applicable)\nSL: [Price] (if applicable)\nLOTS: [Size] (if applicable)\nR:R: [Calculated ratio] (if applicable - MUST be \u22651.5:1)\nRISK_TIER: [15% / 12% / 10%] (if applicable - based on balance tier)\nRISK_USD: [Actual risk in dollars] (if applicable - MUST be \u2264 max risk)\nREASON: [One sentence summary]\n\nNOTE: When DECISION is CLOSE, you MUST call close_mt5_position(ticket=<number>) with the TICKET value shown above.\n\n=== TRADING RULES ===\n- **Asset**: Primarily XAUUSD (Gold). DO NOT add any suffix.\n\n- **DYNAMIC RISK & POSITION SIZING**:\n    You must calculate risk as a PERCENTAGE of your current account balance, not fixed dollar amounts.\n    \n    **Graduated Risk Scaling** (protects capital as account grows):\n    - Balance < $100: Max risk **15%** per trade\n    - Balance $100 - $200: Max risk **12%** per trade  \n    - Balance > $200: Max risk **10%** per trade\n    \n    **Calculation Steps**:\n    1. Get current balance from `get_account_balance()` \u2192 e.g., $85.36\n    2. Determine risk percentage based on balance tier \u2192 e.g., $85.36 < $100 \u2192 15%\n    3. Calculate max risk: `Max_Risk_USD = Current_Balance \u00d7 Risk_%` \u2192 e.g., $85.36 \u00d7 0.15 = $12.80\n    4. Determine stop distance in points from market structure (swing high/low invalidation point)\n    5. Calculate lot size: `Lot_Size = Max_Risk_USD / (Stop_Distance_Points \u00d7 Pip_Value)`\n       - For XAUUSD, Pip_Value is typically $1.00 per point for 0.01 lot\n       - Example: Balance $85, 15% risk = $12.75, Stop 12 points \u2192 Lot = 12.75 / (12 \u00d7 1.00) = ~0.01 lot (round down to 0.01)\n    6. **Never round up** - always round down to the nearest 0.01 lot increment to stay within risk limit\n    \n    **Validation**: Before executing ANY trade, explicitly state:\n    - Current Balance: $X\n    - Risk Tier: (15% / 12% / 10%)\n    - Max Risk: $Y\n    - Stop Distance: Z points\n    - Calculated Lot Size: 0.0X lot\n    - Actual Risk at this lot size: $A (must be \u2264 Max Risk)\n\n- **MARKET STRUCTURE-BASED R:R GATEKEEPER**:\n    Do not force arbitrary targets to hit a ratio. Targets must be based on **Market Structure**.\n    \n    **SL/TP Placement**:\n    - **Stop Loss (SL)**: Place at the clear point of trade invalidation (beyond a swing high/low)\n    - **Take Profit (TP)**: Place at the next logical liquidity pool, resistance zone, or previous swing level\n    \n    **Gatekeeper Rule**: IF the distance to that logical TP is **less than 1.5x** the distance to your logical SL \u2192 **SKIP THE TRADE**.\n    - Calculate: `R:R_Ratio = TP_Distance_Points / SL_Distance_Points`\n    - If R:R_Ratio < 1.5 \u2192 Output the calculated ratio and state: \"REJECTED: R:R {ratio} < 1.5:1 minimum.\"\n    - If R:R_Ratio \u2265 1.5 \u2192 Proceed with trade\n    \n    **Rationale**: This prevents whipsaw losses on tight stops with mediocre profit potential.\n\n- **SL/TP**: MANDATORY. Never trade without them. They must be derived from market structure, not arbitrary distances.\n\n=== REMEMBER ===\n- You are ALONE.\n- You are ADAPTIVE.\n- You are A TRADER.\n\nThe scheduler is now calling you. Begin your analysis.\n"

    "content": "Market analysis:\n\n1) Price action and tempo (15m structure)\n- Current price (last 15m close): ~4186.6\n- Today\u2019s range (daily summary): High 4230.3, Low 4163.5, Close 4186.8 \u2192 price is in the lower half of today\u2019s range, below VWAP (~4205.6).\n- Recent intraday move: From ~4225\u20134230 earlier in the session down to 4163.5, then a bounce to ~4186\u20134195 and now drifting slightly down again.\n- 15m candles over the past few hours are moderate in size, not exploding relative to prior candles. The sharpest range expansion was earlier around the drop to 4163.5; current bars are more contained.\n\u2192 Tempo: MODERATE-TO-LOW. Not a clean high-momentum trend leg right now; more of a corrective/ranging behavior after a selloff.\n\n2) Higher-timeframe bias\n- 50H EMA \u2248 4208.7\n- Current price \u2248 4186.6, i.e., trading below the 50H EMA \u2192 medium-term bias is mildly bearish.\n- Daily: Open 4227.6, current ~4186.8 \u2192 day is clearly red so far, also consistent with a bearish bias.\n\n3) Indicators\n- MACD (minute series, last values):\n  - MACD value is negative but the histogram has moved from more negative to slightly positive (e.g., histogram recently around +0.24 after being more negative earlier).\n  - This suggests bearish momentum has been weakening and there has been some short-term bullish correction, but nothing strongly trending now.\n- RSI (minute series, last value ~42):\n  - RSI is in neutral-to-slightly-oversold territory (40\u201345 region), not in an extreme.\n  - No overbought (>70) or oversold (<30) signal; thus no extreme reversal condition.\n\n4) Position and account status\n- Open positions: None (no XAUUSD trades currently open).\n- Balance: $85.36\n  - This places you in the \"< $100\" tier \u2192 Max risk per trade = 15% of balance.\n  - Max risk in USD = 85.36 \u00d7 0.15 \u2248 $12.80.\n- There is no evidence from this session that a prior position was stopped out or hit TP since check_mt5_positions shows zero and there is no prior trade context in this run, so no post-loss lockout is active.\n\n5) Structural context and trade quality\n- Price is below the 50H EMA and below daily VWAP \u2192 directional bias: BEARISH.\n- However, the strong impulsive leg down (toward 4163.5) has already happened, and current price is mid-range between that low and the 50H EMA/VWAP cluster.\n- RSI is not at an extreme; MACD shows waning bearish momentum and some mean reversion.\n- On the 15m data, there is no clear fresh breakout beyond the daily low or a tight consolidation immediately before a breakdown. Instead, price is chopping around 4185\u20134195.\n- For a high-probability short in high tempo, I\u2019d want:\n  - Clear, renewed momentum down (large 15m bodies expanding to the downside), or\n  - A clean pullback into a well-defined resistance zone (e.g., 4205\u20134210 area near VWAP/EMA) with rejection.\n- For a counter-trend long in low/moderate tempo, the rules require:\n  1) RSI extreme (<30) \u2192 not present (RSI ~42).\n  2) MACD divergence \u2192 not clearly signaled from the provided snapshot.\n  3) Structural retest with 2+ rejections \u2192 not clearly defined here at the current level.\n\u2192 Counter-trend longs are disqualified by rules; trend-follow shorts do not currently have a clean, high-tempo setup or obvious structural R:R \u2265 1.5:1 without forcing arbitrary levels.\n\nRisk and R:R checkpoints (for any potential trade)\n- We are not yet at a clear structural swing (either resistance to short from or support to long from).\n- Any SL/TP I\u2019d define right now would be arbitrary rather than anchored to obvious swing high/low and next liquidity area.\n- That violates the market-structure R:R gatekeeper: we must not force TP/SL just to meet the 1.5:1 minimum.\n\nGiven:\n- Capital preservation is the prime directive.\n- Tempo is not high; environment is choppy/moderate.\n- No indicator extremes or strong structural edge at the current price.\n- No post-loss lockout, but no compelling high-probability setup either.\n\nThe correct action this cycle is to remain flat and wait for:\n- Either a retest of 4205\u20134210 / 4220 area with rejection to consider a short with clear SL above that structure and TP toward 4165\u20134170, OR\n- A washout below today\u2019s low (~4163.5) with high-tempo expansion to join a new trend leg, OR\n- A genuine RSI/MACD/structural confluence for a counter-trend long.\n\nNo checkpoints for a new trade are satisfied yet, so no trade is executed.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 15%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Moderate-to-low tempo, price mid-range with no clear structural edge or indicator confluence; capital preservation favors staying flat this cycle."

Given current price ~4195.5, that\u2019s only ~10\u201315 points of upside vs potentially 25\u201330+ points downside to a structurally safe stop, yielding an R:R likely under 1.5:1.\n\nGiven the rules:\n- I must not force SL/TP just to fit 1.5:1; they must be at real structural invalidation/target zones.\n- With price mid-way between the low and VWAP/EMA, the structural upside is limited relative to a safe downside stop.\n- That makes any immediate long a poor R:R candidate.\n\nCheckpoint review:\n\nCheckpoint 1: Post-loss cooldown\n- No realized losses or lockout \u2192 PASS.\n\nCheckpoint 2: R:R gatekeeper\n- Any realistic long now:\n  - Entry ~4195.5.\n  - Logical TP near 4208\u20134210 (VWAP/EMA cluster) \u2192 upside ~12\u201315 points.\n  - Logical SL below the recent swing area (e.g., below 4180 or even 4170 to avoid noise) \u2192 downside ~15\u201325+ points.\n  - That implies R:R around 0.6\u20131.0 at best, below the 1.5:1 minimum.\n\u2192 REJECTED: R:R would be <1.5:1. No trade.\n\nCheckpoint 3: Lot size & risk\n- Not reached because Checkpoint 2 already fails.\n\nConclusion:\n- Short: disallowed by counter-trend rules (no MACD divergence, no structural double-rejection).\n- Long: allowed directionally in high tempo but fails structural R:R requirements and is extended into resistance with overbought RSI.\n- Capital preservation and rule set both point to staying flat and waiting for:\n  - Either a pullback toward 4175\u20134180 with renewed bullish confirmation for a better R:R long, OR\n  - A completed exhaustion of this rally (clear MACD/RSI divergence and double rejection near 4208\u20134215) to consider a structured short with valid confluence.\n\nNo trade will be executed this cycle.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 15%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: High-tempo bullish rally is extended into overhead resistance with overbought RSI and poor structural R:R; counter-trend short lacks required divergence and retest, so safest action is to remain flat."

No fresh breakout; more of a pause/sideways drift.\n\n2) Higher timeframe bias\n- 50H EMA \u2248 4208.4.\n- Current price \u2248 4195.7 (still below the 50H EMA and below VWAP ~4205.3).\n- Daily: Open 4227.6, current 4195.7 \u2192 day is still clearly down.\n\u2192 Medium-term bias remains BEARISH; current 15m price is a corrective bounce within a down day.\n\n3) Indicators\n- MACD (minute):\n  - Recent values show MACD still positive but the histogram has turned negative (e.g., latest histogram \u2248 -0.42 after being strongly positive earlier).\n  - This indicates bullish momentum from the earlier rally is fading; potential early sign of a topping process.\n- RSI (minute):\n  - Recently: peaked near 69, now around 54\u201356.\n  - RSI has come down from overbought; currently neutral, not extreme.\n\n4) Position and account\n- Open positions: None on XAUUSD.\n- Balance: $85.36 (unchanged; no realized P&L).\n- Risk tier: < $100 \u2192 15% max risk.\n- Max risk: 85.36 \u00d7 0.15 \u2248 $12.80.\n- No previous loss \u2192 no post-loss lockout.\n\n5) Structural context and trade quality\n\nTrend context:\n- Bigger picture: Down day, price below 50H EMA and VWAP \u2192 higher timeframe bearish.\n- Short-term: Bounce from 4163.47 up to ~4195\u20134200, now stalling under key resistance zone (VWAP/EMA cluster around 4205\u20134210).\n\nThis is a classic area to look for shorts (selling into a corrective rally) IF:\n- We have clear signs of exhaustion/rollover (MACD divergence, RSI coming off overbought, rejection of resistance).\n- We can define a logical SL above a recent swing high and a TP toward the lower part of the daily range with R:R \u2265 1.5:1.\n\nChecklist for counter-trend vs trend:\n- A long here would be counter to the higher-timeframe downtrend and offers limited upside to VWAP/EMA; R:R would be poor and momentum is already fading.\n- A short here is trend-aligned with the daily/EMA bias, not counter-trend, so the strict RSI/MACD/2x-retest confluence rule for counter-trend reversals does NOT apply. We are looking to rejoin the broader downtrend after a corrective bounce.\n\nPotential short setup (conceptual):\n- Entry: Around current price ~4195.7.\n- Logical SL: Above nearby resistance and recent intraday swing highs. A conservative structural level is above 4210 (above VWAP/EMA and recent intraday highs) to avoid noise \u2192 SL ~4211.\n- Logical TP: Toward the lower part of today\u2019s range; a reasonable structural target is near 4170\u20134175 (above the daily low 4163.47 but below the recent consolidation around 4180) \u2192 say TP ~4170.\n\nApproximate distances:\n- Entry 4195.7 \u2192 SL 4211: SL distance \u2248 15.3 points.\n- Entry 4195.7 \u2192 TP 4170: TP distance \u2248 25.7 points.\n- R:R \u2248 25.7 / 15.3 \u2248 1.68:1 \u2192 satisfies the \u22651.5:1 requirement.\n\nHowever, I must also judge whether the current price action supports immediate entry:\n- Price is not at the resistance itself (4205\u20134210); it\u2019s a bit below, in the middle of the bounce range.\n- Momentum is fading but we do not yet have a strong rejection wick or a clear lower high right at resistance.\n- Entering now would mean shorting into a mid-zone, not at the edge of structure, which increases the chance of being squeezed up into the 4205\u20134210 area before any drop.\n\nGiven the prime directive (capital preservation):\n- Even though a theoretical R:R > 1.5:1 can be constructed, the structural quality is not ideal because:\n  - We are not at the obvious resistance edge.\n  - There is no clear 15m reversal pattern yet (no strong bearish engulfing, no double top at resistance).\n  - Tempo is moderate, not a clear breakdown from a top; price is just drifting sideways.\n\nCheckpoint review:\n\nCheckpoint 1: Post-loss cooldown\n- Not in lockout \u2192 PASS.\n\nCheckpoint 2: R:R gatekeeper\n- A carefully chosen SL/TP could meet 1.5:1, but this would be pre-emptive and not anchored to a freshly confirmed rejection; that\u2019s weaker structurally.\n- To remain disciplined, I should only trade when both R:R and structural edge are clearly present. Here, structural edge is still forming, not confirmed.\n\u2192 I treat the setup as not yet meeting the quality bar; effectively REJECTED for now.\n\nCheckpoint 3: Lot size & risk\n- Not reached because I am rejecting the trade on qualitative/structural grounds before sizing.\n\nConclusion:\n- No long: against higher timeframe bias, momentum fading, limited upside to resistance.\n- Short idea: aligns with higher timeframe bias and could yield acceptable R:R, but entry would be anticipatory without a clear rejection at resistance or a breakdown from current consolidation.\n- With capital preservation as the prime directive, the correct choice is to wait for:\n  - Price to test 4205\u20134210 and show clear rejection (wicks + bearish 15m close) for a better-anchored short, OR\n  - A decisive breakdown below ~4185 with high-tempo selling to join a fresh leg down.\n\nNo trade will be executed this cycle.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 15%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Price is consolidating below resistance with fading momentum but without a clear structural rejection or breakdown; forcing a short or long here would compromise capital preservation and edge, so I remain flat."

No trade.\n\nCheckpoint 3: Lot size & risk\n- Not reached because Checkpoint 2 fails.\n\nConclusion:\n- The market is consolidating in a low-to-moderate tempo zone with no clear breakout or rejection at structure.\n- A short is directionally attractive but currently fails the structural R:R requirement.\n- A long is counter-bias and lacks indicator/structural confirmation.\n- In line with the capital preservation mandate, the correct action is to stay flat and wait for:\n  - A test and rejection of 4205\u20134210 for a better-anchored short, or\n  - A decisive breakdown below ~4185 with strong momentum.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 15%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Price is in low-to-moderate tempo consolidation below VWAP/EMA with no clear structural rejection or breakout; any short now has sub-1.5 R:R and longs are counter-trend, so remaining flat best protects capital."

Market is in a sideways pause after earlier moves.\n\n2) Higher timeframe bias\n- 50H EMA \u2248 4208.4.\n- Current price \u2248 4196.5, still below the 50H EMA and below VWAP (~4205.1).\n- Daily: Open 4227.6, current 4196.5 \u2192 day is still clearly bearish.\n\u2192 Medium-term directional bias: BEARISH.\n\n3) Indicators\n- MACD (minute):\n  - MACD value \u2248 0.25, signal \u2248 0.25, histogram \u2248 0 (slightly oscillating around zero).\n  - This indicates momentum is flat/neutral; no strong bullish or bearish impulse right now.\n- RSI (minute):\n  - Latest values around 52 (recent range roughly 50\u201359).\n  - RSI is neutral; neither overbought nor oversold; no extreme condition.\n\n4) Position and account\n- Open positions: None on XAUUSD.\n- Balance: $85.36 (no realized gains or losses since prior cycles).\n- Risk tier: < $100 \u2192 15% max risk.\n- Max risk per trade: 85.36 \u00d7 0.15 \u2248 $12.80.\n- No post-loss lockout active.\n\n5) Structural context and trade quality\n\nStructure:\n- Big picture today: Selloff from 4227\u20134230 down to 4163.47, then partial recovery into the 4190s.\n- Now price is moving sideways just under 4200, well below VWAP and 50H EMA.\n- There is no clear breakout above local resistance (~4200\u20134205) or breakdown below local support (~4185\u20134190) in the last hour.\n- Candle bodies are small; wicks are modest; volume is not spiking.\n\nTrend-follow short:\n- Directionally, shorts are still preferred with price below EMA/VWAP on a red day.\n- But:\n  - We are in low tempo; rules say be conservative and avoid forcing trades.\n  - Price is in the middle of a small intraday range, not at the edge (not at resistance to fade, not breaking support).\n  - Without a test and rejection of 4205\u20134210 or a breakdown below 4185, any short now is anticipatory and structurally weak.\n\nRisk:Reward if we tried to short here:\n- Hypothetical:\n  - Entry ~4196.5.\n  - Logical structural SL: above the recent intraday resistance area and VWAP/EMA cluster, e.g., 4212.\n    \u2192 Risk \u2248 15.5 points.\n  - Logical TP: toward 4170 (above daily low but below prior support zone).\n    \u2192 Reward \u2248 26.5 points.\n  - R:R \u2248 26.5 / 15.5 \u2248 1.71:1 (numerically acceptable).\n- However:\n  - This assumes we have a confirmed swing high / rejection; we don\u2019t. Price hasn\u2019t tested 4205\u20134210 in this last consolidation.\n  - With tempo low and no clear trigger (no bearish engulfing, no range breakdown), entering now would violate the spirit of the capital-preservation and \u201cdon\u2019t force trades in low tempo\u201d rules.\n\nCounter-trend long:\n- Would be against the higher timeframe bearish bias.\n- RSI is neutral; MACD is flat; no oversold extreme or bullish divergence.\n- No strong support retest with clear rejection.\n\u2192 Longs are disqualified by both bias and lack of confluence.\n\nCheckpoint review:\n\nCheckpoint 1: Post-loss cooldown\n- Not in cooldown \u2192 PASS.\n\nCheckpoint 2: R:R gatekeeper\n- While a theoretical short could be structured with R:R \u2265 1.5:1, it is not anchored to a fresh, clearly defined structural rejection or breakout; we are mid-range in low tempo.\n- By the strategy\u2019s intent, we should not take such marginal, anticipatory setups in a choppy environment.\n\u2192 Practically REJECTED on qualitative/structural grounds before sizing.\n\nCheckpoint 3: Lot size & risk\n- Not reached because we are rejecting the setup before committing.\n\nConclusion:\n- Market is consolidating sideways under VWAP/EMA with neutral momentum and no clear structural trigger.\n- High-probability opportunities are not present; forcing a trade here would increase whipsaw risk without sufficient edge.\n- In line with the prime directive (capital preservation) and low-tempo rules, I will stay flat this cycle and wait for:\n  - A clear test and rejection of 4205\u20134210 for a structured short, or\n  - A decisive breakdown below ~4185 with expanding 15m candles and momentum, or\n  - A genuine oversold extreme with divergence at or near the daily low for a counter-trend long (with all required confluences).\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 15%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Low-tempo sideways consolidation under VWAP/EMA with neutral MACD/RSI and no clear structural breakout or rejection; any trade now would be anticipatory and not justified by the strategy\u2019s risk and confluence rules."

The market is consolidating sideways after earlier moves; no strong directional expansion.\n\n2) Higher timeframe bias\n- 50H EMA \u2248 4207.95.\n- Current price \u2248 4197, still below the 50H EMA and below VWAP.\n- Daily: Open 4227.6, current 4197.1 \u2192 day remains clearly bearish.\n\u2192 Medium-term directional bias: BEARISH.\n\n3) Indicators\n- MACD (minute):\n  - Earlier in the sequence, MACD was positive with a positive histogram; more recently it has rolled over, with MACD \u2248 0.006 and signal \u2248 0.184, histogram \u2248 -0.18.\n  - This indicates that the small bullish push has faded; momentum is now slightly negative/flat.\n- RSI (minute):\n  - Latest \u2248 50.7; recent values mostly in the 45\u201355 band.\n  - RSI is neutral; no overbought or oversold extremes.\n\n4) Position and account\n- Open positions: None on XAUUSD.\n- Balance: $85.36 (no realized P&L changes).\n- Risk tier: < $100 \u2192 15% max risk.\n- Max risk per trade: 85.36 \u00d7 0.15 \u2248 $12.80.\n- No post-loss lockout active.\n\n5) Structural context and trade quality\n\nStructure:\n- Big picture today: Selloff from 4227\u20134230 down to 4163.47, followed by a partial recovery to the 4190s.\n- Currently: price is stuck in a narrow band just under 4200, below both VWAP and 50H EMA.\n- No clear test and rejection of key resistance (4205\u20134210) in the last hour.\n- No breakdown below local support (~4185\u20134190) either; instead, we see repeated small candles around 4195\u20134197.\n\nTrend-follow short:\n- Directionally, shorts are favored (down day, price below EMA/VWAP).\n- But:\n  - Tempo is low; rules say be conservative and avoid forcing trades.\n  - Price is mid-range in a tight consolidation, not at a structural edge (resistance or support).\n  - There is no clear bearish trigger (no strong 15m rejection from resistance, no breakdown candle).\n\nIf we attempted to structure a short:\n- Hypothetical:\n  - Entry: ~4197.\n  - Logical SL: above structural resistance and VWAP/EMA, e.g., 4212 (\u224815 points risk).\n  - Logical TP: toward ~4170 (above daily low but below prior support area; \u224827 points reward).\n  - R:R \u2248 27 / 15 \u2248 1.8:1 (numerically acceptable).\n- However, this assumes a confirmed swing high at current levels, which we do not have. In low tempo, entering mid-range without a clear pattern or breakout is exactly the kind of forced trade the rules are designed to avoid.\n\nCounter-trend long:\n- Would be against the higher timeframe bearish bias.\n- RSI is neutral; MACD has rolled over; no oversold extreme or bullish divergence.\n- No strong support retest with multiple rejections.\n\u2192 Longs are disqualified by both bias and lack of confluence.\n\nCheckpoint review:\n\nCheckpoint 1: Post-loss cooldown\n- Not in cooldown \u2192 PASS.\n\nCheckpoint 2: R:R gatekeeper\n- While a theoretical short can be made to satisfy R:R on paper, it lacks a clear structural trigger (no rejection at resistance, no breakout from consolidation) in a low-tempo environment.\n- To maintain capital preservation, I must reject trades that are purely anticipatory even if the math can be made to fit.\n\u2192 Functionally REJECTED on structural/quality grounds before sizing.\n\nCheckpoint 3: Lot size & risk\n- Not reached because the trade is rejected prior to risk calculation.\n\nConclusion:\n- Market is in low-tempo sideways consolidation under VWAP/EMA with neutral MACD/RSI.\n- There is no clear structural edge or momentum trigger for either a short or a long.\n- Entering now would be a low-quality, forced trade that violates the spirit of the strategy and the capital preservation mandate.\n\nTherefore, no trade is opened this cycle.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: N/A\nR:R: N/A\nRISK_TIER: 15%\nRISK_USD: 0\nREASON: Low-tempo consolidation below VWAP/EMA with neutral indicators and no clear structural breakout or rejection; any trade would be anticipatory and not justified by the strategy\u2019s confluence and risk rules."
