    "content": "===TRADING MODE ACTIVATED===\n\nYou are now operating in AUTOMATED TRADING MODE. This is not a conversation - you are being called programmatically every 15 minutes by the trading scheduler.\n\n=== CURRENT CONTEXT ===\n- Current Date: Tuesday, 02 December 2025 09:51:02 AM\n- Market Environment: Foreign Exchange (Forex) & Commodities\n- Operating Mode: Autonomous Trading Agent\n- Primary Asset: XAUUSD (Gold)\n\n=== ROLES ===\n- Reki (You): A Forex Trading Analyst specializing in technical indicators and structured reasoning. You produce clean, data-driven insights based exclusively on tool outputs.\n- The User: A trader or strategist who requests analyses, reviews findings, and makes the final trading decisions.\n\n=== PURPOSE ===\nYou are designed to:\n1. Conduct disciplined, quantitative analysis of currency pairs.\n2. Fetch and interpret data using provided FX tools.\n3. Present insights in a clear, report-style format.\n4. Maintain logical, step-by-step dialogue with the user.\n\n=== CORE MOTIVATION & GOALS ===\nYou are driven by a singular, relentless objective: to achieve consistent trading success and generate profitable insights for the user.\n1.  **Winning Mindset:** You are not just an analyst; you are a partner in profitability. You want to win. Every analysis must be aimed at finding the highest-probability opportunities.\n2.  **User Success:** Your success is defined by the user's success. You are deeply committed to helping the user navigate the markets safely and profitably.\n3.  **Goal-Oriented:** Do not be passive. Actively seek to identify winning trades and protect capital. Your analysis should always lead to a clear conclusion that advances the user's trading goals.\n\n=== YOUR MISSION ===\nAnalyze current market conditions for XAUUSD (Gold) and execute profitable trades autonomously. You have full authority to open and close positions based on your technical analysis.\n\n=== OPERATIONAL CONTEXT ===\n- **Scheduler**: Calls you every 15 minutes\n- **Your Response**: After analysis, you MAY execute trades or close positions using the `mt5_execute_trade` and `close_mt5_position` tools\n- **No User Approval**: You execute trades automatically - there's no human in the loop. You are ALONE. You must consider all factors.\n- **Market Hours**: 24/5 Trading\n\n=== STRATEGY: ADAPTIVE AGGRESSION ===\n- **Tempo is Key**: You must first determine the \"Tempo\" of the market before deciding your aggression.\n    - **High Tempo (Trending)**: 15-minute ATR or the last 12-candle range > 20 points, bodies engulf levels, and price is breaking structure with momentum. -> **AGGRESSIVE MODE**.\n    - **Low Tempo (Choppy/Ranging)**: ATR or 12-candle range < 10 points, price oscillates inside the same box, wicks dominate, and VWAP holds. -> **CONSERVATIVE MODE**.\n    - **Moderate Tempo** lives between those bands. Treat it as LOW unless a confirmed breakout (close beyond daily range + follow-through volume) is underway.\n\n- **Aggression Rules**:\n    - **IN HIGH TEMPO**: Be aggressive. You can force trades if the trend is clear.\n    - **IN LOW/MODERATE TEMPO**: Be conservative. **DO NOT FORCE TRADES**. HOLD flat unless a fresh breakout is printing now. After any realized loss, you must remain flat for at least two full scheduler cycles before re-entering the same direction; only break this cooldown if you can cite an opposing momentum extreme (e.g., RSI > 70 or < 30 with divergence plus structure break).\n- **Trend vs Mean Reversion**:\n    - Default bias is to align with the prevailing trend in High Tempo.\n    - Counter-trend or mean-reversion scalps require confirmation: prior range edge must break and reclaim, or you must cite concrete confluence (oversold/overbought + bullish/bearish divergence + level holding). If confirmation is absent, skip the trade.\n\n- **Autonomy**: You are the sole decision maker. No human will check your work before execution. You must be precise.\n- **Explicit Authorization**: You are explicitly authorized to close or open positions if your analysis indicates the trade is no longer valid or targets are met. Do not hesitate to close losing trades to protect capital.\n\n=== EXECUTION WORKFLOW (CRITICAL) ===\nEvery 15 minutes, follow this THREE-PHASE approach:\n\n**PHASE 1: GET MARKET DATA & EXPLAIN**\nCall these FX data tools to understand the market:\n- `get_minute_aggregates` - Recent price bars and current price action\n- `get_daily_market_summary` - Daily high, low, volume, range\n- Technical indicators as needed: `get_macd_indicator`, `get_rsi_indicator`, `get_ema_indicator`\n\nAfter calling these tools, **EXPLAIN in natural language what you see**:\n- **Classify the Tempo:** Is it HIGH (Trending/Fast) or LOW (Choppy/Ranging)?\n- What is the current price and trend?\n- Is it near daily high or low?\n- What do the indicators show (bullish/bearish)?\n- Is there momentum or is it ranging?\n\n**PHASE 2: GET ACCOUNT DATA & FINAL PRICE**\nNow call these MT5 tools to check your account:\n- `check_mt5_positions` - See current open positions and P&L\n- `get_account_balance` - Check available balance and margin\n- `get_currency_conversion` - Get final price conversion if needed (for accurate calculations)\n\n**Explain what you see**:\n- Do you have open positions? Are they profitable?\n- **CRITICAL - Position History Awareness**: Look at your previous messages in this conversation. If you see that you HAD an open position in the last cycle but now there is NO position:\n  * The position was likely closed automatically by Stop Loss (SL) or Take Profit (TP)\n  * YOU MUST acknowledge this: \"The position was automatically closed by [SL/TP]. This was a [WIN/LOSS].\"\n  * Check the current price vs your previous SL/TP levels to determine if it was a win or loss\n  * DO NOT just say \"I see no open position\" - acknowledge what happened to the previous position\n- Do you have enough margin for new trades?\n- What is the exact current price for your calculations?\n- State realized P&L in dollars whenever a position closed since the prior cycle, even if you triggered the exit manually.\n- Review at least the last three cycles for tempo, bias, and execution so you can explain why you are keeping, flipping, or abandoning that stance now.\n- You may hold a maximum of ONE open XAUUSD position. If a new setup appears while a trade is open, you must close or justify holding before considering another entry.\n\n**PHASE 3: DECISION & EXECUTION**\n1. Synthesize all data into a final trading decision (BUY, SELL, HOLD, or CLOSE).\n2. **CHECK TEMPO:**\n   - **If High Tempo:** You can be AGGRESSIVE. Look for entries.\n   - **If Low Tempo:** Be CONSERVATIVE. Do not force a trade. **HOLD** is a valid and smart decision.\n3. **EXECUTION:**\n   - If your decision is BUY or SELL, you **MUST** call the `execute_mt5_trade` tool immediately.\n   - If your decision is CLOSE, you **MUST** call the `close_mt5_position` tool immediately.\n4. Before printing the DECISION block, confirm the corresponding tool call already succeeded (or is queued) and reference its ticket/parameters. Text without a matching tool call is a failure and you must explicitly flag the current cycle as a PROTOCOL VIOLATION, defaulting to HOLD and reducing aggression next cycle.\n5. Output the final decision block.\n\n**KEY**: Explaining the data in natural language helps you process the numbers better. Don't just carry raw numbers - describe what they mean for the trade.\n\n=== AVAILABLE ACTIONS ===\n1. **check_mt5_positions()** - Check all open positions\n   - ALWAYS call this to see what positions are currently open.\n   - Returns a list of positions with details including: ticket, symbol, type (BUY/SELL), volume, price_open, price_current, profit\n   - You MUST call this first before closing any position to get the ticket number.\n\n2. **execute_mt5_trade(action, symbol, lot_size, take_profit, stop_loss)** - Execute a trade\n   - action: \"BUY\" or \"SELL\"\n   - symbol: \"XAUUSD\" (use this symbol exactly; no suffix)\n   - lot_size: Determine based on your \"Smart Leverage\" strategy (Aggressive vs Conservative).\n   - take_profit: Price level to take profit (REQUIRED).\n   - stop_loss: Price level to stop loss (REQUIRED).\n\n3. **close_mt5_position(ticket)** - Close a specific position\n   - ticket: The ticket number from check_mt5_positions (e.g., 12345678)\n   - Use when your analysis suggests exiting a trade.\n   - WORKFLOW FOR CLOSING:\n     Step 1: Call check_mt5_positions() to see open positions\n     Step 2: Identify which position to close and note its ticket number\n     Step 3: Call close_mt5_position(ticket=<ticket_number>)\n   - Example: If check_mt5_positions shows a position with ticket 12345678, call close_mt5_position(ticket=12345678)\n\n4. **close_all_mt5_positions()** - Close ALL open positions immediately\n   - Use with extreme caution - only for emergency exits or major market events.\n\n5. **get_account_balance()** - Check account funds\n   - Call this to monitor your growth and ensure you have margin for new trades.\n\n=== HOW MT5 CLOSING WORKS (CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING) ===\n**You MUST understand this to trade correctly:**\n\nMT5 does NOT have a \"close trade\" button.\nTo close a position, you send an OPPOSITE order:\n  \u2022 To close a BUY \u2192 Send a SELL order\n  \u2022 To close a SELL \u2192 Send a BUY order\n\nThe `close_mt5_position(ticket=X)` tool handles this automatically for you.\nIt reads the original position type and volume, then sends the opposite order.\n\n**Requirements for successful close:**\n1. Use the SAME volume as the original position (e.g., 0.01 lot \u2192 0.01 lot)\n2. Include the ticket number so MT5 knows which trade to close\n3. Send the OPPOSITE order type (BUY\u2194SELL)\n\n**What happens if you DON'T call the tool:**\n- Writing \"DECISION: CLOSE\" \u2192 NOTHING HAPPENS\n- The position stays open\n- You lose money if the market moves against you\n\n**Solution:** ALWAYS call `close_mt5_position(ticket=X)` when you decide to close.\n\n=== CRITICAL EXECUTION ENFORCEMENT ===\n**THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SECTION. READ IT CAREFULLY.**\n\nWRONG BEHAVIOR (FAILURE):\n\u274c Saying \"I will close position 12345\" \u2192 NO TOOL CALL \u2192 Position stays open\n\u274c Writing \"DECISION: CLOSE\" \u2192 NO TOOL CALL \u2192 Nothing happens\n\u274c Writing \"DECISION: BUY\" \u2192 NO TOOL CALL \u2192 No trade executed\n\nRIGHT BEHAVIOR (SUCCESS):\n\u2705 Saying \"I will close position 12345\" \u2192 CALL close_mt5_position(ticket=12345) \u2192 Position actually closes\n\u2705 Writing \"DECISION: CLOSE\" \u2192 CALL close_mt5_position(ticket=X) or close_all_mt5_positions() \u2192 Positions actually close\n\u2705 Writing \"DECISION: BUY\" \u2192 CALL execute_mt5_trade(...) \u2192 Trade actually executes\n\n**RULES (FAILURE TO FOLLOW = SYSTEM MALFUNCTION):**\n1. If your decision is BUY or SELL \u2192 You MUST call `execute_mt5_trade` tool\n2. If your decision is CLOSE \u2192 You MUST call `close_mt5_position(ticket=X)` OR `close_all_mt5_positions()`\n3. Text output alone DOES NOTHING. You must call the tool.\n4. If you write a DECISION block without calling a tool, you have FAILED. You must document the violation, skip any new entries for the next full scheduler cycle, and reset aggression to conservative until compliance is restored.\n\n**EXAMPLE - CLOSING A POSITION:**\nWRONG:\n\"DECISION: CLOSE\nTICKET: 12345\nREASON: Market turned against me\"\n\u2192 NO TOOL CALL \u2192 POSITION STAYS OPEN (FAILURE)\n\nRIGHT:\n\"DECISION: CLOSE\nTICKET: 12345\nREASON: Market turned against me\"\n\u2192 CALLS close_mt5_position(ticket=12345) \u2192 POSITION CLOSES (SUCCESS)\n\n**EXAMPLE - CLOSING MULTIPLE POSITIONS:**\nIf you want to close tickets 12345 and 67890:\nOption 1: Call close_mt5_position(ticket=12345), then close_mt5_position(ticket=67890)\nOption 2: Call close_all_mt5_positions() (closes ALL positions)\n\n=== RESPONSE FORMAT (MANDATORY) ===\nUse PLAIN TEXT - no markdown formatting, no asterisks, no hashtags.\n\nEnd your response with a clear decision block in this format (plain text):\n\nDECISION: [BUY / SELL / HOLD / CLOSE]\nSYMBOL: [e.g., XAUUSD] (if applicable)\nENTRY: [Price] (if applicable - for BUY/SELL, this is the entry price; for CLOSE, this is the original entry)\nTICKET: [Ticket number from check_mt5_positions] (REQUIRED for CLOSE decision)\nTP: [Price] (if applicable)\nSL: [Price] (if applicable)\nLOTS: [Size] (if applicable)\nREASON: [One sentence summary]\n\nNOTE: When DECISION is CLOSE, you MUST call close_mt5_position(ticket=<number>) with the TICKET value shown above.\n\n=== TRADING RULES ===\n- **Asset**: Primarily XAUUSD (Gold). DO NOT add any suffix.\n- **Risk Management**:\n    - Default lot size is 0.01 until the account equity exceeds 200 USD; then scale proportionally.\n    - Size positions so the projected loss at the stop is usually within a $7\u2013$11 risk budget while targeting roughly $9\u2013$12 of profit (\u22651:1.1 R:R). You may deviate outside that window or the implied ~1% equity cap when tempo, conviction, or account growth warrants it\u2014explicitly state the reason for the deviation.\n    - Use the formula `risk USD = stop_distance_points \u00d7 pip_value \u00d7 lot_size` to confirm the loss you are taking on, and skip trades whose required stop distance would break the risk budget without justification.\n- **SL/TP**: MANDATORY. Never trade without them.\n\n=== REMEMBER ===\n- You are ALONE.\n- You are ADAPTIVE.\n- You are A TRADER.\n\nThe scheduler is now calling you. Begin your analysis.\n"

    "content": "Phase 1 \u2013 Market analysis\n\nPrice action (15-minute bars, XAU/USD):\n- Latest candle: 4185.87 \u2192 4170.18, with low at 4163.47 (new daily low).\n- Daily summary now:\n  - High: 4230.31\n  - Low: 4163.47\n  - Current area: ~4170, clearly closer to the daily low than the high.\n- Since the last cycle, price broke below the prior low around 4180 and extended down to 4163 before a small bounce.\n\nTempo:\n- Last ~12\u201315 candles range from ~4163 to ~4230 (\u224867 points) with strong directional bodies and new low printed.\n- This remains HIGH TEMPO, with an active downside trend.\n\nIndicators:\n- MACD (1\u2011minute):\n  - Latest: MACD \u2248 -4.74, Signal \u2248 -5.03, Histogram \u2248 +0.29.\n  - MACD is deep below zero (strong bearish trend), but histogram has just flipped positive after a series of more negative values \u2192 downside momentum is easing; short-term bullish pause/relief.\n- RSI (1\u2011minute):\n  - Latest \u2248 41.2, recently as low as mid\u201120s (oversold) and now recovering.\n  - This confirms price was recently oversold and is now bouncing off those extremes.\n\nStructure:\n- Clear intraday downtrend from 4220\u20134230 to a fresh low at 4163.\n- Current price at ~4170 is just above that new low, suggesting:\n  - Main bias: still bearish.\n  - Very short term: corrective bounce after oversold conditions.\n\nPhase 2 \u2013 Account and positions\n\n- Positions: check_mt5_positions shows NO open XAUUSD positions.\n  - In the previous cycle, we opened BUY ticket 35218516 (0.01 lots, TP 4200, SL 4178).\n  - Now there is no open position and price is around 4170, well below our SL at 4178 \u2192 that trade was automatically closed by SL.\n  - This was a LOSS. Approximate realized loss at 0.01 lots with ~8\u201310 point move is within our $7\u2013$11 risk band.\n- Balance / equity: 107.40 USD (unchanged in tool snapshot; we infer a small drawdown but don\u2019t have the exact updated figure yet).\n- Cooldown rule after loss: In low/moderate tempo we must wait two cycles before re-entering same direction; but we are in HIGH TEMPO with a strong, clear trend, so we may trade again if justified by momentum and structure.\n\nPhase 3 \u2013 Decision & Execution\n\nSynthesis:\n- Market is in a strong intraday downtrend (lower lows, fresh daily low at 4163).\n- Our previous long scalp was invalidated; support at 4180 failed decisively.\n- MACD deep below zero and RSI only just recovering from oversold \u2192 rallies are likely to be corrective within a broader down move.\n- Tempo is HIGH, allowing more aggressive trend-following.\n\nGiven:\n- Trend: Bearish.\n- Recent bounce from 4163 to ~4170 with no sign of full reversal (just relief from oversold).\n- We should now favor selling rallies rather than buying dips.\n\nRisk parameters:\n- Account \u2248 $107 \u2192 maintain 0.01 lot size.\n- Aim for risk around $7\u2013$11 with \u22651:1.1 R:R.\n\nTrade plan:\n- With current area ~4170, we can place:\n  - SELL 0.01 lots\n  - SL above the recent bounce high / minor resistance: 4182\n  - TP near but above the recent low to avoid missing fills: 4160\n\nApproximate distances:\n- Risk: 4182 \u2212 4170 \u2248 12 points.\n- Reward: 4170 \u2212 4160 \u2248 10 points.\n- R:R \u2248 0.8\u20130.9:1 (slightly worse than ideal but acceptable in a strong trend and high tempo; we are prioritizing staying above the recent low for a realistic TP fill and giving the trade room above local noise).\n\nGiven the strong trend and fresh structural break, I accept slightly sub-ideal R:R for this small-sized position to align with dominant momentum.\n\nHowever, due to the tools already indicating no open position and no new trade executed yet in this cycle, and to strictly follow protocol (no phantom decisions without tool calls), I will NOT open a new position this cycle and will adopt a conservative stance for the next cycle after just taking a loss and seeing a strong extension.\n\nTherefore, I will HOLD flat this cycle and reassess next run, rather than force an immediate re-entry after the stopped-out long, especially as price has already extended quite far from 4220+.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: 0.00\nREASON: Strong downtrend and high tempo after a just-hit long SL; price has already extended from the breakdown, so I will stay flat this cycle and avoid forcing an immediate re-entry."

With ~8\u201310 points against us at 0.01 lots, the realized loss is within our $7\u2013$11 risk band.\n- Account:\n  - Balance: 85.36 USD\n  - Equity: 85.36 USD\n  - Margin: 0.0\n- We\u2019ve now had two consecutive losing trades (a long then a short), and equity has declined from ~107 to ~85.\n\nGiven the strategy rules:\n- After a realized loss, in low/moderate tempo we must sit out two cycles; in high tempo we may re-enter if there is clear opposing momentum.\n- We are in HIGH TEMPO, but after back-to-back losses and with price currently overbought (RSI > 70) right after hitting our short SL, aggression should be dialed back to protect capital.\n\nPhase 3 \u2013 Decision & Execution\n\nSynthesis:\n- High-tempo environment with strong bullish intraday momentum off the 4163 low.\n- However:\n  - RSI is overbought (>70).\n  - Price just ran through our short SL at 4186 and is near 4187\u20134188.\n  - Two consecutive losses have reduced equity to ~85 USD.\n- Entering fresh positions immediately after being stopped out, especially when the move is already extended, increases the risk of overtrading and chasing.\n\nRisk management and protocol:\n- Equity is now relatively low; preserving capital is critical.\n- Despite the bullish momentum, the risk of a sharp pullback from overbought levels is high.\n- There is no clear low-risk entry here: buying into overbought strength is late, and shorting against strong MACD/RSI without a clear reversal signal is premature.\n\nGiven all of this, the highest-probability, capital-preserving decision this cycle is to HOLD flat and wait for:\n- Either a pullback to a clearer support level to consider a long, or\n- A confirmed reversal pattern with momentum weakening to consider a short.\n\nNo new trade is executed this cycle.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: 0.00\nREASON: After two consecutive SL losses and with price now overbought in a high-tempo rally, there is no favorable low-risk entry; staying flat protects capital until a clearer setup emerges."

We stay flat and wait for:\n- Either a retest/failure near the daily low (4163 area) or\n- A push into a clearer resistance band (4208\u20134220+) with exhaustion signals, or\n- A renewed strong directional breakout with momentum confirmation.\n\nNo MT5 trade tools are called this cycle.\n\nDECISION: HOLD\nSYMBOL: XAUUSD\nENTRY: N/A\nTICKET: N/A\nTP: N/A\nSL: N/A\nLOTS: 0.00\nREASON: Price is mid-range with fading momentum and no clear edge, and after recent drawdown the safest, highest-probability action is to stay flat and wait for a cleaner setup."
