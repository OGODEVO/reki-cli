[2025-11-30 20:43:48] Agent Response: MT5 is currently unreachable (`Cannot connect to MT5 API at http://localhost:8000`), so I cannot open or close any positions this cycle. I’ll still summarize market conditions and outline what I would do once connectivity is restored.

**1. Market Snapshot (XAUUSD / “XAU/USD” feed)**  
- 15m data shows price recently around **4218.5**.  
- 50‑period SMA (1‑minute) ≈ **4218.53** – price is essentially sitting on its short-term mean → **no clear trend edge** from this alone.  
- RSI (1‑minute, 14): latest ≈ **48.2** → **neutral**, neither overbought nor oversold.  
- MACD (1‑minute):  
  - Latest MACD ≈ **0.00120**, signal ≈ **0.00046**, histogram positive (≈ **+0.00074**).  
  - MACD recently flipped from slightly negative to positive and is above the signal line → **mild bullish momentum** on the very short-term.

**2. Structure / Volatility (15m bars)**  
From ~08:43 to 21:28 on 2025‑11‑28 (Friday session):  
- Price climbed from lows near **4110–4150** up to **~4220+**.  
- That’s a **strong intraday uptrend** over the last active session.  
- The last few 15m bars cluster around **4215–4220**, suggesting **consolidation after a strong run-up**.

Combined view:
- Higher‑timeframe (intraday) bias: **bullish** (strong advance from ~4110 to ~4220).  
- Very short‑term (1m indicators): **neutral‑to‑slightly bullish** (MACD > 0, RSI ~48).  
- Price is near its short‑term mean, not at an extreme.

**3. Trading Logic (What I would do if MT5 were online)**  

Given:  
- Trend: Up over the last session.  
- Momentum: Mild bullish on 1m, no exhaustion signals.  
- Location: Price near intraday highs, but not showing reversal signals yet.  

I would lean to a **small, conservative long (BUY) near 4218–4220**, targeting a modest extension higher, with a tight stop below the consolidation.

Example plan (once MT5 connectivity is restored and current price confirmed around these levels):

- **Direction:** BUY  
- **Symbol:** XAUUSD  
- **Entry:** ~**4218.5** (around current price)  
- **TP:** ~**4230.0** (≈ +11.5 points; intraday extension above recent highs)  
- **SL:** ~**4210.0** (≈ −8.5 points; below local consolidation lows)  
- **Reward:Risk:** ≈ 1.3–1.4 : 1  
- **Lot size:** **0.10 lots** (conservative, because:  
  - Weekend / limited liquidity context,  
  - MT5 connectivity unstable,  
  - Market is in consolidation, not a fresh breakout.)

If I see a clear breakout above recent highs with strong momentum on the next calls, I would consider **increasing aggression** (larger lot or a second add‑on position with adjusted SL/TP).

**4. Operational Constraint**

I attempted to check open positions but got:

> `success: false, error: "Cannot connect to MT5 API at http://localhost:8000"`

Because of that, I **cannot**:
- Verify current holdings,  
- Place new trades,  
- Or adjust SL/TP right now.

As soon as the MT5 API is reachable again, I will:
1. Re‑check positions.  
2. Re‑validate current XAUUSD price vs this plan.  
3. Execute a trade only if conditions still align (trend intact, no sharp reversal).

---

**DECISION:** HOLD (no new trade – execution system offline)  
**SYMBOL:** XAUUSD  
**ENTRY:** N/A (would target ~4218.5 once MT5 is reachable)  
**TP:** N/A (would target ~4230.0)  
**SL:** N/A (would set around ~4210.0)  
**LOTS:** N/A (would use ~0.10 lots conservatively)  
**REASON:** Bullish intraday structure with mild short-term upside bias, but MT5 API is currently unreachable, preventing safe trade execution and position management.

[2025-11-30 21:37:42] Agent Response: The forex market (including XAUUSD) is currently **closed**, so no live price data is available and **no trades can be executed right now**.

Key points from tools:
- `get_minute_aggregates` for XAU/USD returned: **No data found – market might be closed**.
- `get_market_status` shows: **fx: closed**, `market: closed`.

Because:
- There is no live price feed.
- MT5 cannot execute trades without an active market.
- Any SL/TP levels would be speculative rather than based on executable prices.

I must stay flat until the market reopens.

**ENTRY:** N/A  
**TP:** N/A  
**SL:** N/A

[2025-11-30 21:40:42] Agent Response: The forex market is currently CLOSED according to the latest market status data (`fx: closed`), which is why no intraday data is available for XAU/USD and no trades can be executed right now.

With FX closed:
- No reliable live price feed for XAUUSD.
- Any MT5 trade execution would be queued or rejected depending on broker settings.
- Placing new trades now would not be precise in terms of entry, SL, or TP.

Therefore, I will NOT open or modify any positions this cycle. I’ll resume full technical analysis and autonomous trading as soon as the FX market reopens and intraday data becomes available.

[2025-11-30 21:56:46] Agent Response: Forex markets (including XAUUSD) are currently **closed**, which is why no intraday data is available and no trades can be executed safely or reliably.

**PHASE 1 – MARKET DATA**

- `get_minute_aggregates` for XAU/USD returned: **No data found**.
- `get_market_status` shows:
  - `currencies.fx: "closed"`
  - `market: "closed"`
- This means there is **no live price feed** and spreads/liquidity from brokers will either be unavailable or highly unreliable.

Without a valid real-time feed, any TP/SL placement would be guesswork rather than data-driven, violating the risk management rules.

**PHASE 2 – ACCOUNT & POSITIONS**

Since the FX market is closed, I will **not** query or alter MT5 positions this cycle. Even if positions exist, most brokers won’t execute new market orders or modifications until the market reopens, and quoting may be frozen.

**PHASE 3 – DECISION & EXECUTION**

Given:
- FX market is **closed**.
- No valid intraday XAUUSD data.
- Any order placement would be non-executable or dangerously mispriced.

The only rational, capital-preserving action now is to **hold and wait** for market open, at which point I’ll:
- Pull fresh intraday data (5–15 min bars).
- Run indicators (RSI, MACD, EMAs).
- Check MT5 positions and balance.
- Then decide whether to open/close trades with precise TP/SL.

**DECISION:** HOLD  
**SYMBOL:** XAUUSD  
**ENTRY:** N/A  
**TP:** N/A  
**SL:** N/A  
**LOTS:** N/A  
**REASON:** FX market (including XAUUSD) is currently closed, so reliable pricing and order execution are not available; no new trades will be placed until the market reopens.

[2025-11-30 21:57:59] Agent Response: PHASE 1: MARKET DATA & CONDITIONS

- The data provider reports: “No data found for XAU/USD (Ticker: C:XAUUSD). The market might be closed or the pair name is incorrect.”
- Market status tool shows: fx = CLOSED, overall market = CLOSED, server time ~ 16:57 (Saturday US time equivalent, weekend conditions).
- Conclusion: Forex and spot gold (XAUUSD) are currently not trading; there is no live price feed, no intraday candles, and no valid liquidity to base entries on.

This means:
- No reliable current price.
- No valid intraday trend/momentum assessment.
- Any attempt to set TP/SL would be guesswork, not data-driven.

PHASE 2: ACCOUNT / POSITION STATUS

- MT5 positions check for XAUUSD returned an error: terminal not found / not connected.
- So:
  - I cannot verify whether there are open positions.
  - I cannot verify balance, equity, or margin.
  - I cannot safely manage risk or adjust any existing trades.

Given both:
1) Market is closed for FX/gold.
2) MT5 terminal is not accessible via the tool right now.

PHASE 3: DECISION & EXECUTION

With the FX market closed, any trade execution attempt would either fail or be queued into illiquid/undefined conditions at the next open. That violates the requirement for precise, data-backed entries with clear TP/SL based on current price action.

Therefore:
- No new trades should be opened.
- No position management actions can be safely taken because MT5 is not accessible.

I will wait for:
- FX status = open
- Valid XAUUSD price data and intraday bars
- Successful MT5 connectivity

Then I can:
- Re-assess trend, momentum, and volatility.
- Size positions based on live price and account data.
- Place orders with precise TP/SL.

DECISION: HOLD
SYMBOL: XAUUSD
ENTRY: N/A
TP: N/A
SL: N/A
LOTS: N/A
REASON: Forex/gold market is currently closed and MT5 terminal is not accessible, so no data-backed or executable trades can be placed safely.

[2025-11-30 22:27:22] Agent Response: Account balance check failed: the MT5 API returned “Failed to fetch account info: Not Found”, so I cannot confirm connectivity or see balance, equity, or margin.

Because this is a TEST RUN with the instruction to only call get_account_balance() and not use any other tools, and since the balance request failed, I will not attempt any market analysis or trade execution. There is no verified account connection, so placing trades would be unsafe even if it were allowed in this mode.

Summary:
- MT5 connectivity: Not confirmed (get_account_balance() returned an error).
- Account balance: Unknown.
- Action: No trades, no further tool calls.

DECISION: HOLD
SYMBOL: XAUUSD
ENTRY: N/A
TP: N/A
SL: N/A
LOTS: N/A
REASON: MT5 account connection not confirmed (get_account_balance failed) in test mode, so no trading actions are taken.

[2025-11-30 22:39:52] === CYCLE START ===
[2025-11-30 22:40:21] Agent Response: Phase 1 – Market data and technicals

Price action:
- Latest 15-minute bar for XAU/USD: 4218.53 (open = high = low = close), volume = 1.
- Daily summary for 2025-11-30: O = H = L = C = 4218.53, volume = 1.

This indicates effectively no real trading activity or a non-trading environment (weekend/illiquid feed): price is flat, no range, and volume is minimal.

Indicators:
- MACD (minute data): values are extremely close to zero with tiny histogram changes; no meaningful bullish or bearish momentum.
- RSI (minute): ~48.2, which is neutral (neither overbought nor oversold).

Conclusion from Phase 1:
- Market feed for XAUUSD is essentially static right now, likely due to weekend closure or illiquid conditions.
- There is no identifiable trend, no volatility, and no actionable momentum. Any SL/TP levels would be arbitrary because the price is not moving.

Phase 2 – Account and positions

Positions:
- check_mt5_positions for XAUUSD returned an error: “Terminal: Not found”.
  - This suggests the MT5 terminal is not connected/available or the symbol is not recognized in the current session.
  - Practically, I must assume there are no controllable open positions via the tool right now.

Account:
- Balance: 89.03 USD
- Equity: 89.03 USD
- Margin: 0.0 (no open trades)
- Free margin: not provided, but effectively ~89.03 USD.

With such a small account and no margin currently used, risk management must be very conservative when markets are actually open. However, since the market appears inactive and the MT5 terminal is not properly responding for positions, execution reliability is questionable at this moment.

Phase 3 – Decision and execution

Given:
- XAUUSD price is frozen with no real-time volatility (weekend/non-trading conditions).
- Technical indicators are neutral and not informative in a flat market.
- MT5 position query failed, indicating connectivity or terminal issues.
- Entering trades in a non-moving market is pure guesswork and can lead to poor fills or errors once markets reopen.

I will not execute any trade under these conditions. Best action is to hold and wait for:
- Normal market activity (non-flat candles, real volume, real range).
- Stable MT5 connectivity and confirmed symbol availability.

DECISION: HOLD
SYMBOL: XAUUSD
ENTRY: N/A
TP: N/A
SL: N/A
LOTS: N/A
REASON: Price and volume are effectively static (likely weekend/closed market) and MT5 terminal returned an error for positions, so there is no reliable, high-probability setup or safe execution environment to justify a trade.
